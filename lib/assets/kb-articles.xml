		<field name="content">Nothing beats a complete listing in terms of being matched to renters in search results. When details are missing, the listing won't appear in search results at all when a renter uses a relevant search filter. 

However, **SpaceFinder does reward boosted search result ranking for venues who have opted into features that offer added convenience to renters.**

##Search ranking order:

1. Listings w/ Space Requests + Online Payment enabled
1. Listings w/ Space Requests + View Calendar
1. Listings w/ Space Requests
1. Listings w/ View Calendar
1. All other listings

Because of alphanumeric order, renters have an easier time discovering you if you remove articles like &quot;The&quot; from your organization name and venue listings. When renters search, they look for the name &quot;Fantastic Studio Space&quot; not &quot;The Fantastic Studio Space.&quot;  

A high page ranking is great for connecting with renters, but keep in mind keyword searches disrupt the page ranking logic. Being strategic about keywords used in your space description and equipment inventories will increase your matches to renter searches.

TIP: With the exception of Online payment, which a small fee is associated with, all of the other features that get you boosted search ranking are FREE!

** 1. List Each Space**

 If have multiple spaces for rent and you created one listing for all your spaces (theatre, studio, meeting room, etc.), you saved a little time but you're missing out on renters understanding the unique aspects of each space you have available when they use the search filters. Free listings are unlimited, and the &quot;clone&quot; duplication feature saves you time. List each space! 

**2. Enter Rental Rates**

 One of the top search criteria used by renters is rental rate. If you haven’t entered rental rates (at least a minimum or average) for your space, your space won't appear when renters search by rate.

**3. Add Photos/Videos**

 Renters consistently tell us that photos are one of their most valued features in a listing. Help renters imagine their event in your space. Upload photos of empty space as well as your space in use. Have a great video tour of your space? Add that too!

**4. Promote Empty Time Slots**

 Uploading your booking calendar Makes it easier for new renters to discover you by promoting your up-to-date empty time slots. All it takes is uploading a link to the digital calendar you use to manage your rentals.

		<field name="content">## What is the hourly rates form?
**The hourly rates form is more than how you display the cost of renting your space,** it is how you organize the ‘inventory’ of what your space has to offer. We understand rental prices are determined by a number of factors and have created a flexible form that functions to connect your space to renters narrowing down their search by rental rate (often a top concern for renters).

## Where do I input this information?
**You can access this page on the left side of your dashboard under the ‘Manage This Space’ column**. Make sure you have selected all the possible uses for your space in the ‘Space Usage’ tab first (such as Rehearsal, Special Event, etc.) as the Hourly Rates form allows you to enter a rate for each Space Usage selected.

![space usage affects the hourly rates forms](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=410 &quot;space usage affects the hourly rates forms&quot;)

## How do I fill it out?
**You will need a separate Hourly Rates form for each pricing scenario in your space**. If everything is $20/hr all day, every day for any type of usage than you’ll only need one form. This, however, is rarely the case. Many spaces have weekend rates or early bird specials, and if the cost is different it needs a new form. Also, the price might differ based on usage. It is common for rehearsal and audition rates to be different, so each type of usage will need a new form as well. If that is the case &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; you have special weekend rates than you’ll need a form for weekend auditions, weekday auditions, weekend rehearsals, etc.

		<field name="title">What if the Hourly Rates Form Doesn't Fit My Pricing Model?</field>
		<field name="content">## What are my options if my pricing doesn't quite fit into the hourly rates form?  
We understand there are many different types of pricing models. At the same time rental rate is often the most important thing to a renter looking for space within their budget. Think strategically about how you want to communicate and be found by your rental rates. Remember if you don't enter any rate info in your listings forms, renters searching by rate will not find you. If you don't communicate at least a minimum rate renters are more likely to contact another venue they know they have the budget for.

## Some options to consider:
* Enter minimum rates in the form** and clearly communicate additional details in the basic description. This will depend on the type of targeted renter you want to connect with, marketing goals, and volume of requests you get for your space.

* Enter maximum rates in the form and clearly communicate additional details in the basic description

* Upload a document with additional rental rate details

* List a range of rates in the basic description</field>

		<field name="id">12</field>
		<field name="title">How do I Show a Range of Rental Rates?</field>
		<field name="content">The hourly rates form is one of the most important parts of your listing. While listing rates is optional, without them you will not appear in rental searches by rate. Beyond giving renters a guideline of what your space will cost, hourly rates perform the following functions:

1.  Rates are displayed on the listing.
2.  They're used in searches by rate.
3.  Rates are also used to display availability when uploading a calendar. Rates are defined by time periods because they display when your venue is open and closed.
4.  The rates are also used to calculate the cost for rental requests and receipts. This is why more than one number in a form field is not accepted because the system wouldn't be able to calculate a total.

In order to achieve maximum flexibility while still giving renters a guideline, spaces can have multiple hourly rate forms.

Each rate form is defined by the following criteria:

*   **Days** the space is available, and the rate applies.
*   **Hours** the rate is in effect.
*   **Uses** the rate is permitted for.
*   And the cost of the **rate** itself.

##Hourly Rate Examples
We understand that venues have different cost models for their spaces, so the hourly rates form has been designed with flexibility in mind.

For our first example, we'll use a studio that has one hourly rate the entire time it's open.

![sample studio hourly rates](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=417 &quot;sample studio hourly rates&quot;)

*   The studio is available 7 days a week from 10am-10pm.
*   The rate is $15 per hour with no special member or non-profit rates.
*   The only available use for this space are small group or one on one uses.

In this case. We'll only need one hourly rate.

Displaying a Range of Rates

Now let's take a space with three different prices depending on the usage:

I have three different prices for the space depending on usage: Rehearsal, Class, Anything Else (auditions, performance, special event, etc.) Each of these uses is more expensive on the weekends when the space is in greater demand.

**The weekday rates per hour look like this:**  

| **Weekday** | **Regular** | **Nonprofit** |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Rehearsal   | $15         | $10           |
| Class       | $25         | $15           |
| Other       | $40         | $35           |

**And the weekend rates per hour look like this:**

| **Weekend**   | **Regular** | **Nonprofit** |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Rehearsal     | $20         | $10           |
| Class         | $30         | $20           |
| Other         | $50         | $40           |

Because there are 12 possible prices for renters I will need different rate schedules.

Here is a sample of what the weekday rehearsal form will look like:

![Weekday hourly rates form](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=418 &quot;weekday hourly rates form&quot;)

**Note**: Only the weekday and rehearsal boxes are checked.The nonprofit rates are in the lower right corner.

For contrast, here is the weekend ‘other uses’ form. Notice that because they all have the same rental rate, all uses besides classes and rehearsals are checked off:

![Weekend hourly rates form](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=419 &quot;weekend hourly rates form&quot;)

Once you have all six hourly rates forms filled out for the Dance Studio, renters will see a **range of rates** for each space usage.

		<field name="title">Tips for Selecting Photos that Attract New Renters</field>
		<field name="content">One of the most useful things you can do to promote your rentals is to upload photos of your space. Whether you are using photos taken with your smart phone, or have professional photos, in order to attract new renters who've never been to your space before, photos are key. They're the first thing that prospective renters look at when considering a space. We've even polled renters about what they find helpful in their searches for space, and the majority agreed that having a visual of the space is super important.

As the venue account holder, you get to select one primary photo that stands out to renters looking at search results. (You'll be able to add as many photos as you'd like to your listing as well.) The images are slightly larger than a thumbnail and the primary photo should be choosen strategically:

**Primary photo winners:**

**Photos with high contrast or color**
   ![Project Gallery, Toronto](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=509 &quot;Project Gallery, Toronto&quot;) 

**Photos that show the space in use in a compelling way**
   ![Brooklyn Ballet Studio, Brooklyn, New York](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=507 &quot;Brooklyn Ballet Studio, Brooklyn, New York&quot;) 

**Photos that feature windows, or light sources**  
   ![Green Space Studio, New York](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=508 &quot;Green Space Studio, New York&quot;) 



**Primary photo mistakes to avoid:**

- Dimly Lit/Dark Photos
- Floor plans (these are great, but upload them as documents, rather than images)
- Photos with logo or text (it doesn't read at thumbnail size)
- Logos (these will be taken down by Site Administrators, renters want photos of the space)
- Photo files that are so small the image is pixelated or blurry</field>

**If you have spaces that are similar to one another, you can expedite this process by cloning your listings.** Cloning a listing creates a second space with nearly the exact same information as the original including possible uses, rates, amenities, and size. We recommend completing your listing before you Clone it. It's usually easier to change what's different than to re-enter what is the same.

Here's what information is _not_ cloned:

*   Images
*   Documents
*   Hourly Rates

**Here's how you clone a listing:**

 1. Create a Comprehensive Listing

 Build one listing with as much pertinent information as possible. Include all possible uses for the space, a narrative description, rates, rental/cancellation policies, and a full list of available equipment and amenities.

  ![Add a Space from dashboard](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=500 &quot;Add a Space&quot;) 

 2. Clone your listing

 Once you've built a listing similar to your other spaces, go to your **Dashboard** and click **Space Listings**. You can then click **Clone **to make a copy.

  ![Clone a space from dashboard](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=501 &quot;Clone a Listing&quot;)

*   Click **Dashboard**
*   Choose **Space Listings** under the manage account menu
*   Select **clone** next to the space you want to copy
*   Do a victory dance.

All you need to do is change the space name and any other relevant information (square footage, new images, etc), take the space online, and you're all set! Then, when renters search through the directory, they'll see your listings together and be able to differentiate between the different types of spaces that you've got available to them.

You can also **Manually Update** your calendar by going to the share my calendar page on your listing.

The time of day and how long it takes for the automatic refresh will vary based on how many calendars are being added to the system at any given moment. You can view when your calendar will next refresh and decide if a Manual Update is preferred.

The time it takes for a manual update to complete will also vary on how many calendars are being synced. It could be relatively instantaneous and it could take up to 30 minutes if it's a high traffic moment for users adding or updating calendars.

A little background on why this feature works in this way (if you're curious):

When developing a solution for connecting renters to space based on availability, we carefully weighed the pros and cons of integrating with venue calendars. The huge positive to integration is we can serve many different types of venues and staffing situations across the arts field and nationwide. If we required venues to all use the same calendar we would be able to more easily offer &quot;real-time&quot; calendar data but participation across the field would be greatly limited. We encourage feedback on the topic of calendar update timing and will continue to monitor this feature.

Once you have rates set, you'll need to upload your digital calendar(s) to the listing. No specifics of your activities will be visible, only what times are available. Many different calendars are compatible with our system, and it just takes a few minutes to set up.

**3. Publish Calendar**
Once the calendar is uploaded, double check the availability is showing accurately (you may have to refresh the page) and check the &quot;Publish To Listing&quot; box.

##Confirm That Your Google Calendar is Public

1.  Log in to your Google Account and select the calendar you want to share.
2.  Select **Share This Calendar**.
    
 ![share this calendar detail](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=460 &quot;share this calendar&quot;)
3.  Confirm your Google Calendar is public.  Select &quot;Hide details&quot; if you do not want to make the names and details of your calendar events public.  
    ![Make Calendar Public](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=461 &quot;Make Calendar Public&quot;)

##Copy Google Calendar Feed

1.  In your Google account, find the calendar you want to share and click the dropdown menu. The button is a square with a downward pointing triangle when you move your mouse over it.
2.  Select Calendar Settings.  
    ![Calendar Settings](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=462 &quot;calendar settings&quot;)  

3.  In the Calendar Address section, click the bright green ICAL button. A pop-up window with your calendar's public URL containing the .iCalendar feed will appear. Select and copy the entire URL.  It will look something like this:  
    https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/d473a6885d5e/basic.ics

    ![Google Calendar Address](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=463 &quot;google calendar address&quot;)

##Upload your iCal Feed

1.  On your listing's Share My Calendar Page, click the **Upload Your Calendar feed** button.  
    ![Share my calendar on a SpaceFinder Listing](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=466 &quot;share my calendar&quot;)
2.  Paste that public iCal URL into the field. That URL should end with .ics
3.  Click **Add Calendar **to upload the feed. It may take a couple of minutes for the feed to appear on the calendar preview.

**A public Google Calendar is one that is searchable on the web.** For businesses or artists that want to promote their Calendar activities and have the general public be able to read event details, making your Google Calendar public is a good choice.

Even while making it public, you can choose the level of details that are shared. Hiding your details shows when you have blocked out time on your Calendar, but not what that time is being used for.

*   Confirm your Google Calendar is public and set to &quot;Hide details&quot; (this is option is under Share this Calendar)  
    

![make this calendar public](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=470 &quot;make this calendar public&quot;)

**Private calendars are unsearchable and can only be shared through invitation.** Both private and public calendars can be synced to your SpaceFinder listing, but they do have different URLs.

*   To share a Private Google Calendar make sure to select the Private Address iCal

##All-Day Event Set-Up
**Make Sure &quot;all day&quot; events on your calendar are marked as Public in the Event Detail Settings **

* All-day events won't show up in your calendar feed unless you specifically set the Privacy Setting for the Event as Public when you create the booking. Even if your general calendar privacy setting is set to Public. 

* The &quot;Default&quot; Setting will not allow the all-day booking to show up in your calendar feed. You'll need to un-check that option when you set up your Event!

		<field name="title">Troubleshooting: Availability is Not Accurate on Calendar</field>
		<field name="content">**Here's a checklist to help you troubleshoot why your rental schedule and availability are not showing up accurately in your listing's calendar feed.** Remember when you are looking the calendar feed on your listing, you should only see your unbooked times as open blocks of time.

### Is the Hourly Rates Form on your listing correct?

*   The Hourly Rates Form combines your daily business hours along with your rates for specific types of rentals. The hours of business reflected in your hourly rates form should match your actual schedule. 
*   Example: If your Hourly Rates Form says you are open from 8am-4pm, but your space is really open from 10am-10pm, your calendar feed will show zero availability from 4pm on. That's a lot of rentals you could miss out on!

### Are all the online calendars you use to manage your rental schedule synced to your space listing?

*   Lot's of people use more than one calendar to manage a particular space. Maybe you have Nighttime Events and Meetings on a separate calendar, but both activities happen in the same space. 
*   You can sync as many calendars to one space listing as you need in order to make sure that all of your available/booked time for each use of a specific space is accounted for. 

### Do you have bookings on your calendar marked as tasks, communicate &quot;available&quot;, etc.?

*   Only bookings scheduled as **Events** will show up in your calendar feed. 
*   If you've marked a rehearsal as a Task accidentally, it won't show up in the feed, and will look like available time to renters on your listing.

### Are events on your venue's online calendar marked as &quot;all day&quot; even if they are for a certain period of time?

*   You could be accidentally telling renters you are booked all day when you have an few hours free!

### Google Calendars: Are &quot;all day&quot; events on your venue's online calendar marked as Public in the Event Detail Settings?

*   We've found that even if your general calendar privacy setting is set to &quot;Public&quot; and your specific Event privacy settings are set to &quot;Default&quot; to the privacy settings of your calendar, all-day events won't show up in your calendar feed. &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.45em;&quot;&gt;See how to set up your All-Day Events in our&lt;/span&gt; [privacy settings article.](/site/knowledgebase/google-calendar-settings-public-vs-private)

### Does your online calendar have sync limitations?

*   Certain calendar software limit how far into the future they will sync event data, for example MindBody sync 30 days into the future. Some spaces who use Mindbody show their calendar in order to benefit from higher visibility, but provide renters with specific links in the listing for renters to click through and book space.

### Is your iCalendar feed refreshed?

*   Calendars refresh automatically once a day. You will see a countdown to your next refresh with the option to [manually refresh.](/site/knowledgebase/automatic-manual-updates-to-calendar)</field>

		<field name="content">**If you're trying to upload your Google calendar and you see this message:** *&quot;There was an error trying to download this feed&quot;
*
No need to worry, it's most likely because your Google calendar is set to *Private*, but you uploaded a *Public* version of the iCalendar feed. **This is an easy fix, follow the steps below**:

## 1. Go to your Google Calendar and select &quot;Share This Calendar&quot;

  ![Google Share This Calendar Option](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=468 &quot;Google 'Share This Calendar' Option&quot;)


## 2. Select and copy the iCal under *Private* Address

 ![Goolge Calendar private address URL](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=471 &quot;Google Calendar private address&quot;)

## 3. Go to SpaceFinder listing and select &quot;Share My Calendar&quot;

## 4. Select &quot;Remove&quot; and clear previous calendar causing error

## 5. Select &quot;Upload calendar&quot; and paste Private Address copied from Google

Remember, it's technically the same calendar, just with the corresponding privacy settings

## 6. Refresh page to preview uploaded calendar
Confirm no error message

## 7. High five yourself, and publish calendar.

**Pro Tip:** If you enter the iCal URL into your web browser, it should download a file named **Basic.ics.** If the page takes you to a Google-Branded Error page, it means the feed is not public.

		<field name="content">**For venues who have enabled [Online Space Requests](/site/knowledgebase/space-request-forms-features-benefits), you also have the option to export the rentals data collected via those online forms.**


This is can be useful both when you want to export contact info for all of your renters, and even more so when you want to learn from your rental activity and make informed decisions.

## Common questions that an export of data can help answer:

- What usage of space is most popular (class, special event, etc.)?
- What usage of space is bringing in the most money?
- Who are the loyal return renters?
- What are the most common reasons for a renter's space request being denied?
- What are the most common reasons for a cancellation or a refund? 

## To export Space Requests follow these steps:

1. Login to your SpaceFinder account 
2. Go to your Dashboard
3. Select 'Space Requests'
4. Filter your report by date
5. Click 'View' to load the data
6. Click 'Export'
7. CSV file will be emailed to the email address you logged in with

## CSV file will include the following columns:


- By (who created the Space Request, an Admin or the Renter).
- Renter's Organization
- Renter Name
- Renter's Email
- Renter's Phone Number
- Date/Time of Reservation
- Created (Date Space Request was created)
- Space Requested
- Use of Space (rehearsal, performance, etc.)
- Membership (renter answered 'yes' to being a member of your organization)
- Request Status (can be Approved, Denied, or Cancelled)
- Reason for canceling
- Amount (total cost of the rental. if a partial refund has been processed the net total will show)
- Payment Method (if credit card was used, the type of card and last four digits will be displayed. If &quot;Other&quot; is selected as a payment option by the Admin when creating a Space Request, whatever is entered will be displayed. For example &quot;Cash&quot;, &quot;Invoice #201&quot;, &quot;workstudy&quot;, etc.)

		<field name="title">Space Request Forms Features &amp; Benefits</field>
		<field name="content">**Space requests are online forms submitted via SpaceFinder by a renter interested in booking your space. They are a free way to organize requests for bookings and provide the following benefits:**

## Streamline follow up with renter

By requiring renters to provide the info you need up front via a simple form, it makes it easier to quickly get back to a renter about their request. Renters receive automated email notifications when you approve their space request, ensuring you and the renter are on the same page with rental details, and cancellation policies.

## Boost your ranking in search results

Listings with space requests enabled display a &quot;Book Online&quot; button in search results and are rewarded boosted ranking in search results.

## Track what your space is being used for

To enable the Space Request form you are required to provide a rental rate for each different use of your space (performance, rehearsal, special event. etc.) By doing this you are empowering tracking of what your space is being used for. We provide a list view report of rentals by use, which can be sorted by date and exported for further analysis.

## Gain insight from your rentals data

Using online Space Requests allows you to organize and export important data about your renters. Info gathered from the form is stored in your account, so you can track your rental trends; for example: what types of rentals your space is most being used for. 

## Collect and export renter contact info

Rental contact info is collected in the Space Request form and can be easily exported. This  can come in handy when you have something relevant and exciting to share with renters for example offering loyal renters long term rental deals, or announcing a new membership model for discounted space.

## Streamline accepting payment

Taking payment upfront streamlines the interaction on the day of the rental. The renter will input their credit card information, but will NOT be charged until you approve the request.  Early payment also means security for both you and your renter. The total is calculated based on your [Hourly Rates form](/site/knowledgebase/hourly-rates-forms), so make sure this information is complete.

*Note: Taking payment does NOT mean renters automatically book space. All requests must first be approved by the venue manager.*

## Help Fractured Atlas measure impact

Space Requests are optionally for a venue. If you decide you prefer a renter to call or email you, we do not put up a barrier for that option. However, thinking big picture for a moment, there is no way for us to measure when a renter calls or emails you. By turning Space Requests on you are not only making a savvy online business choice that makes you stand out from the competition, you are also helping us measure the impact of SpaceFinder as a subsidized service. We are able to track (and celebrate) the total dollar amount of rental requests submitted through Space Request forms.

Reminder: Approving the request DOES NOT automatically add it to your calendar.

## Denying Space Requests

To deny a space request, select the option from the details view, and enter a reason for the renter. This will be emailed to the renter **as it is entered into the comment box.**

## What the Renter Sees ##

1.  The renter makes a space request.  

    ![Contact Space Manager Form](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=400 &quot;Contact Space Manager Form&quot;)  

2.  The renter then enters credit card payment information as the final step in submitting the request. The renter is reminded the card will NOT be charged unless the request is approved.  

    ![Renter Payment Information](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=398 &quot;Renter Payment Information&quot;)

## What the Venue Manager Sees ##

		<field name="content">## What is Charge Renter?

Charge Renter is an easy way to process credit cards in person or over the phone using SpaceFinder. It is part of the suite of optional features included in Booking Engine. You do not have to be using online booking to use Charger Renter, this provides maximum flexibility in how you want to manage payment for rentals.

## What benefits does Charge Renter offer?

Charger Renter is a streamlined way to process payment, [email receipts](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/rental-receipt-emails), keep a transaction history, and [send automated reminder emails to your rental customers](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/auto-reminder-emails-for-renters) and [process refunds](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/refunding-a-renter-s-credit-card-).

 ![enter image description here](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=562 &quot;Booking Engine - Charge Renter Workflow&quot;)

## What are the fees to process credit cards?

&lt;span class=&quot;wysiwyg-font-size-medium&quot;&gt;To keep SpaceFinder a free resource for renters and free for venues to list their spaces, there are some small fees associated with using online booking to collect rental payments. &lt;/span&gt;

- 1.5% of the rental amount goes to arts non-profit Fractured Atlas; these funds are split with our local partners to sustain SpaceFinder websites&lt;/span&gt;

- 2.9 % + $.0.30 of the rental amount goes to credit card processing; this is the cost of secure online banking using our payment processor, Stripe.&lt;/span&gt;

These are the only fees. There are no monthly payments. And, get ready for this... there are NO FEES FOR REFUNDS (which can really add up, especially if you have a pretty forgiving cancellation policy).&lt;/span&gt;

## What rental specifics features are there?

**Charger Renter was created with venue rentals in mind.** When performing a transaction, you can input as much rental specific information as you need including who is using your space, what for, when, and for how long. You can also send automated email reminders for bookings taken over the phone. In addition, you may also use charge renter for rental related sales like piano tunings, equipment rentals, etc. by selecting the 'other' category under your planned activities.

Because Charge Renter works independently from your listing, you have the freedom to offer flexible pricing, discounts, or additional costs as needed.

## Can I see my rental history?

**A record of all transactions are kept in your dashboard searchable by date and renters name. ** Rental transactions include an overview of the renter, day of rental, amount paid, and payment type.  You can also access details of each rental and edit the information or issue whole/part refunds as necessary.

Your list of transactions, in whole or part, is exportable into a basic CSV spreadsheet which you can use in other CRM (customer relationship management) systems.

		<field name="content">**In the case of a reservation cancellation, issuing a full or partial refund to a renter's credit card is at the sole discretion of the Space Manager.** 

Issuing a refund will update the Space Request status to 'Cancel', send a cancellation/refund confirmation email to the renter, and a credit (full or partial) will be processed to the renter's credit card. Here are a few things to be aware of:

## No Refund Fees (Whoot!)

While many online payment systems charge you a fee to process a refund, Fractured Atlas has integrated SpaceFinder with a system that DOES NOT. We understand that cancellations and refunds are a just part of the reality of running a venue. You will not be charged any fees to refund a renter. Over the course of running a venue, this savings can really add up! [Click here to see more about fees](/site/knowledgebase/rental-transaction-fees).

## Credit Card Refund Limitations

Refunds made through SpaceFinder are only possible _before_ the rental date and time passes. After the rental date and time passes, venues are responsible for issuing refunds at their discretion and outside of SpaceFinder (by check, rental credit, other).

## How to Process a Refund/Cancellation

1. Open your Space Requests and click on the date of the transaction you want to refund.

  ![Rental Information to Refund](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=489 &quot;Rental Information to Refund&quot;)

2. Select **Edit Request**.
 
 ![Edit Rental Request to Refund](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=488 &quot;Edit Rental Request to Refund&quot;)

3. Click the **Refund** tab and choose the reason for the cancellation. Partial refunds may be performed by changing the refund amount.

  ![Refund Rental Transaction](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=490 &quot;Refund Rental Transaction&quot;)

** This will complete the refund and trigger a refund confirmation email to the renter with the following information:**

Subject: Your reservation has been canceled

Your reservation at [space_name] on [reservation_date] from [starting_time] — [ending_time] has been canceled by the space's manager.

[reason_for_canceling]

If you did not request this cancellation please contact the space directly (details below).

Your credit card has been issued a refund of $X.00.

Refunds are issued by space managers according to the space's cancellation policy (listed below). If you feel that you are entitled to a refund (full or partial) that you did not receive, please contact the space directly.

[space_contact_info]

[space_cancellation_policy]

## Refund Tips

- The 'reason for canceling' is entered by the Space Manager and will be displayed both in the email to the renter _and_ on the transaction record for future reference.
- [Credit Card Status](/site/knowledgebase/credit-card-status-answering-your-renter-s-questions-about-a-charge-or-refund-) will display as 'Refunded Fully' or 'Refunded Partially'.
- If you cancel a reservation on the same day it was approved, no charge will show on the renter's card. (And therefore no refund will need to be processed.)

		<field name="content">### In order to give great customer service to your repeat renters, the Booking Engine provides easy access to the status of a credit card charge or refund.


'Credit Card Status' is displayed both in the list view of Space Requests as well as the Reservation detail page. Below are the options for credit card status and what they mean:


**Charged:** reservation was _approved_ and credit card charged

**Refunded Fully:** reservation was _cancelled_ and full rental fee is refunded to credit card  

**Refunded Partially:** reservation was _cancelled_ and partial rental fee refunded to credit card

**Settled:** reservation was _approved_ and rental total (minus fees) has been transferred to venue bank account. Note: It takes a few days after being settled for bank account to record the transaction, this varies by bank.


### Credit Card Status will be blank when:

- Payment made is via a method _other_ than a credit card (cash, check, barter, etc.)
- Reservation request was _denied_ (credit card was never charged)
- Reservation request is _pending_ (has not been approved or denied yet)
- Reservation request is _expired_ (was not approved or denied before requested rental date passed)

### Tips &amp; Reminders

- Renter will see **your venue name** on their credit card
- Reason for cancellation/refund is displayed in the transaction record
- When searching for a rental transaction by name, it will be the name entered for the Renter (not always the same name as on the credit card)
- When searching for a rental transaction by name, use exact spelling and punctuation

If a renter believes they have not received a receipt by email, please check the following:

## 1\. Confirm renter email address is correct

**Confirm the email you have in the rental transaction is the correct one for the renter.** Sometimes simple things like name typos or switching a domain ending from .org to .com can cause an email to get sent to the wrong place.

## 2\. Remind renter the email doesn't come from venue directly

**Renters may not realize the receipt email comes from SpaceFinder **and may be looking for something from the venue email address. Each email notification states the name of a venue in the subject line.

## 3\. Did renter check email spam folder?

**Some spam filters are very sensitive and may have captured the email notification.** Have the renter check their spam folder for any email from the SpaceFinder website; it may have landed there instead of their inbox.</field>

Here is how the fees breakdown if you are accepting payment (online, over the phone and in person) thru SpaceFinder:

- 1.5% of the rental amount goes to arts non-profit Fractured Atlas; these funds are split with our local partners to sustain SpaceFinder websites as a free resource for artists.

- 2.9 % + $0.30 of the rental amount goes to payment processor Stipe; this is the cost of secure online banking transactions.

**These are the only fees.** There are no monthly payments and no fees for refunds (that's right, we said &quot;NO FEES FOR REFUNDS&quot;, which is huge for rentals business where cancellations are natural part of business, those refund fees can really add up).

Rental revenue automatically deposits to your bank account on a 2-day rolling basis. 

In deciding if processing payment through SpaceFinder's Booking Engine is right for your rentals business, ask yourself these questions:

*   Am I missing out on bookings because I only accept cash or check?

*   Am I spending too much administrative time processing and depositing cash and check?

*   Am I being asked for analysis of my rentals revenue, but it isn't all in one place where I can export it?

*   How much am I paying per year in refund fees with my current credit card processor?

See below for how the math breaks down:

		<field name="content">### Online booking is a great way to offer convenient payment options to renters and streamline your communications.   
  

*Online booking is not a way to automatically book space.* A space request is just the first step in the rental process and developing a relationship with the renter. Renters must send a space request and are only charged after the request is approved by a venue manager.

To enable online booking complete the following steps for each listing:

**1. Complete Hourly Rates Form**

Each permitted use must have an hourly rate assigned to it in order for it be booked online. The hourly rates form also reflects your hours of business. More information on filling out this form can be found in the Hourly Rates Article.

**2. Upload Calendar**

(Optional, but encouraged)

Once you have rates set, you can upload your digital calendar to the listing. No specifics of your activities will be visible, only what times are available. Once the calendar is uploaded, double check the availability is showing accurately (you may have to refresh the page) and check the &quot;Publish To Listing&quot; box.

**3. Authorize Your Account to Accept Credit Cards**

To receive advanced payments for your rentals and accept credit cards in person or over the phone using Charge Renter, you need to authorize rental revenue to be deposited into your bank account.

**4. Enable Space Requests**

(Optional, but encouraged)

Select which space listing you want to enable Space Requests on. And select the parameters for a space request in the settings. For example you can control, how much lead-time is required, and the minimum length of a booking. Once you have successfully enabled space requests, renters will see the BOOK ONLINE button and your listing will be boosted to the top of search results.

		<field name="content">**Including rental information and workflows on your own website site can be tricky.** You are likely promoting a lot of things on your website such as events, programming, classes and fundraising campaigns. Rentals are often just an aspect of all the amazing things your organization is offering. It can difficult to build out the rental workflows you want on your website, and updating information or adding photos isn't always easy without website administrator help. **A practical solution is to integrate your SpaceFinder rentals listings into your own website**.

**By linking your SpaceFinder listing, you can easily direct potential renters to everything they need to know about booking your space.** Even if you already have information for your site available, it's easy to link directly to the Space Request Form so when a renter does contact you, they'll have already provided the information *you* need to rent your space.

## 1\. Link to your accounts &quot;Rentals Homepage&quot;

**The most straight forward method is to create a direct link on your website to your SpaceFinder listing.   
**Your Rentals Homepage displays a list of all your available spaces with a short description and photo. From there renters can click on an individual space to get more detailed information.

 ![Link from JACK Rentals page](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=413 &quot;Link from JACK Rentals page&quot;)

## 2\. Link each space on your site to the corresponding listing

**If you have some rental info on your site, you can still link through to the calendar so renters can deeper details, like availability.**

Many spaces already include a list of their inventory on their site that includes basic information. From that list of spaces, it's easy to link directly to the detailed information about each space so renters have access to the nitty-gritty without it taking up room on your own webpage. This is a great way for renters to check out your calendar and see when the space they want is available.

 ![Link from Opera America Space Listings](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=414 &quot;Link from Opera America Space Listings&quot;)

## 3\. If a calendar is already embedded on your website, link directly to a space request form.

**If you already have a calendar and information about the space on your site, you can direct renters to fill out the rental information you need.**

Instead of the usual email back and forth between renters and venue managers, you can use the Space Request form to make sure you get all the info about the rental you need right away. Using the Online Booking approval system, you can also receive payment upfront for the rental. You can also automate sending reminders about upcoming rental and copies of your rental/cancellation policy so you'll know they are informed.

**If you have a question related specifically to a venue's space, its rental policy, booking a space, or your rental, it’s best to contact the venue directly.** Each listing specifies a venues’ preferred method of contact.

		<field name="content">**We empathize with the challenge in finding affordable space.** It's a huge part of why Fractured Atlas maintains [SpaceFinder](http://spacefinder.org) as a subsidized service. It is also why we work with venues and encourage them to be transparent about their rates on SpaceFinder so you can search based on your hourly, weekly or monthly space budget. **Above and beyond searching by rate, here are some savvy ways to reduce your costs:**

![ElephantDollar](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=796 &quot;ElephantDollar&quot;)


## Tips specific to finding affordable space using SpaceFinder:

### 1. Search by Square Footage or Capacity

Venues who choose NOT add their rates to their listings don't show up in your search results by rate. However most intimate spaces are often also the most affordable. If you search for space by 'Square Footage' or 'Capacity' this can be a good way to find more affordable spaces.

### 2. Use Keyword Search to find Alternative Spaces

All the world is a stage and Fractured Atlas is purposely inclusive of all sorts of spaces in SpaceFinder. Theatres, concert halls, museums, and dance studios are listed along with churches, libraries, cafes, rooftops, retail stores, comedy clubs, historic homes, community centers, and other places open to creative activity happening in their space. Sometimes being open to alternative spaces can save you money, sometimes not - but worth a look at what is out there. Using keyword search is a good way to quickly explore alternative spaces.

![KeywordGIF](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=795 &quot;KeywordGIF&quot;)

### 3. Search by Alternative Payment (Barter, Work Study, FREE)

You can discover spaces willing to exchange something other than money for use of their space by using the SpaceFinder search filters for Barter, Work Study and FREE.

![Search by Rental Rate](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=553 &quot;Search by Rental Rate - SpaceFinder&quot;)

![Free Space](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=554 &quot;Free Space&quot;)

## Tips for finding affordable space beyond SpaceFinder

### 1. Qualify for Non-Profit Rates
Many venues offer a lower rental rate to non-profits. Did you know fiscally sponsored projects are also eligible for non-profit rates? Venues are often willing to extend non-profit rates as long as you provide a letter from your fiscal sponsor confirming you are a charitable project.

If you are [fiscally sponsored](/site/fiscal/) by Fractured Atlas, we are happy to write venue letters so you can qualify for non-profit rental rates, please contact [support@fracturedatlas.org](mailto:support@fracturedatlas.org). If you are fiscally sponsored by an organization other than Fractured Atlas, see if they offer the same service, they likely do and it doesn't hurt to ask.

### 2. Ask venue about subsidized rates
The cost to run a space is often higher than what artists can pay to use it. Certain funders have recognized this problem and stepped up with resources so a more affordable rate can be charged to artists. This is often referred to as a &quot;subsidized&quot; rental rate. Qualifications vary by venue - in some cases an application is required, and in others all that is required is your use of the space fall within certain parameters. Venues often have a limited number of subsidized hours each year, so be an informed consumer: inquire if a venue offers subsidized rates and how you can participate.

### 3. Offer Venue a Longer Commitment

Many venues are willing to consider a lower rate if a space will be rented consistently over a longer period of time. It never hurts to ask or negotiate.

### 4. Offer to Pay Venue Up Front

Sometimes being willing to pay up front helps a venue with cashflow in a way that is worth coming down on the rate a bit.

### 5. Don't Overpay on Event Insurance

Some venues require &quot;proof of liability insurance&quot; in order for you to rent their space. If you get insurance from a company that doesn't really understand the risks of a creative project, you could be overpaying.

Fractured Atlas helps creative projects with [liability insurance](/site/liability/). Our friendly staff are brokers who also come from artistic background, so we understand both worlds. *Learn more here: [When Venues Require Liability Insurance](/site/knowledgebase/when-a-venue-requires-liability-insurance)*

		<field name="title">When a Venue Requires Liability Insurance</field>
		<field name="content">Working in a venue space carries unique, associated risks and exposures. To limit these risks, venues may require their renters to carry insurance:

**General liability insurance** covers damage to locations and injury to bystanders. This coverage is available on an annual and short-term basis, to fit your needs.

**Why do certain venues require it from renters?**  

Venues will often require proof of insurance from renters to confirm that they have coverage in place. They may also ask to be listed as an Additional Insured entity for the risks and exposures related to your operations; this means that your insurance comes into play before any the venue carries.

**Why do some venues offer a master plan for their renters?**  

Venues can offer a TULIP (Tenant/Users Liability Insurance Protection) plan, which allows you to be covered under the venue's insurance policy. This type of policy can keep your claims separate from the venue's, while making sure that everyone can be covered. Venues can offer to include you as insured under a TULIP policy for an additional fee or include the cost in the rental charges.

**What exactly does a Certificate of Insurance (COI) from cover?**  

A Certificate of Insurance is the document that provides proof of insurance, listing the venue as either Certificate Holder or Additional Insured (if this was requested).

**Additional insurance help:**  

[Fractured Atlas](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/about/): Fractured Atlas, the non-profit technology company that powers SpaceFinder, also helps the creative sector by offering affordable business insurance for the arts. In addition to being brokers for insurance, our friendly staff also come from artistic backgrounds, so they get both sides. Fractured Atlas has helped over 15,000 creative projects secure insurance. Depending on what else is involved in renting out your venue space, you may consider requiring other insurance types, which we can also help out with. For more info please visit our main [Insurance Program page](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/liability/).

**Note:**  

Fractured Atlas can only secure insurance for groups based in the US with US tax IDs.

**Canadian-based insurance help:**  

Many Canadian venues who require liability insurance work with their own preferred insurance providers, so start by asking a venue directly about options. Otherwise the Insurance Bureau of Canada is a general resource.</field>

		<field name="title">How does Online Booking Work?</field>
		<field name="content">##Is there a fee to book online?
Nope. Renters do not pay an additional fee to book online through the website.

##Do I have to create a username and password?
Nope. If you are interested in the features that come with creating an account (saved searches, etc.) we do encourage renters to create a username and password, however, it is not required for online booking.

##Will I start getting SPAM if I book online?
Nope. We occasionally send relevant email updates when we have great feature releases worth letting you know about, but we don't turn on automated notifications based on online booking or try to endlessly &quot;upsell&quot; you.

##Who do I contact if I have a question about the rental?
Always contact the Space Manager directly regarding questions about rental. In many cases a preferred method of contact will be indicated.

![contact space manager button](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=481 &quot;contact space manager button&quot;)

##Can I book more than one space at a time?
Not at this time. Currently the booking system creates a transaction for each individual date/time/space requested. This allows for flexible refund policies as well as nifty features like an automatic email reminders 12 hrs before your booking with details and a map.

##Why am I asked for my credit card with some spaces and not with others?
Venues have the option to accept space requests with or without securing online payment up front. This varies from listing to listing.

##How far in advance do I need to book online?
The default is 2 business days but venues have the option to increase or decrease the lead time for online booking. Some Space Managers are able to respond to within hours or same day and welcome last minute online bookings. Others (often because of staffing limitations) require more time. The lead time required to book online is communicated below the listing calendar.

![space requests 2 days in advance default](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=483 &quot;the default is 2 days in advance&quot;)

##How is &quot;Total Rental Cost&quot; calculated for online booking?
Date, time, space usage, and rental rates are all variables in calculating the total cost for online booking. Changing any of these variables may change your total cost.

For example: certain days of the week or times of day can be a lower rental rate. Read the listing carefully to fully understand your online booking and offline booking options.

##What should I expect after I complete my Space Request to book online?
You'll receive an email with the details you submitted in your space request for reference.

Once the Space Manager approves or denies your request you'll receive an email confirmation. Depending on the type of rental the Space Manger might contact you directly for more information.

##What is the cancellation/refund policy?
Cancellation, refund and booking policies are specific to each space.  Before you complete an online booking request you are asked to review those policies and confirm you agree to them.

##When will my credit card be charged?
When your Space Request is approved by the Space Manager.

##Can I use an international credit card for online booking?
Yes. Many of our venues welcome renters from around the world, so we are happy to facilitate online booking for all. For the transaction to be approved, The card has to have a major carrier logo: American Express, Visa, MasterCard or Discover. Debit cards without a major credit card logo are not accepted.

##Where do I go if I have great ideas about how to make online booking better?
We welcome feedback via spacefinder@fracturedatlas.org.</field>

3.  **How do I charge for tickets?** Activate some kits. Head to **Account Administration** by clicking on your email in the upper-right corner. Click **Add** for any kits you'd like to activate.
4.  **What do customers see when they buy tickets? **Try selling some tickets (Remember - your storefront is live: work with free tickets so your card is not charged.) through the [box office, Storefront and widget](/site/knowledgebase/four-sales-channels-explained). It's good to know what your customers will see when they buy their tickets in case they ever ask you questions.
5.  **How can I collect donations on my own site? **[Install the Artful.ly widget.](/site/knowledgebase/what-is-the-widget-and-how-does-it-work &quot;What Is The Widget and How Does It Work&quot;) With the widget installed your customers can donate right on your site, and the donations are automatically logged in Artful.ly.

As you sell tickets tickets to your test event you'll see their records populate in your [Artful.ly CRM](/site/knowledgebase/what-is-a-crm-and-why-do-i-need-one &quot;What is a CRM and Why Do I Need One?&quot;). When working with the CRM, it's a good idea to start with [people records](/site/knowledgebase/people-records-overview &quot;People Records Overview&quot;) and move on to importing your other records such as donations and event attendance later. 

1.  **How do I fill up my CRM?**  [Create some individual records](/site/knowledgebase/how-do-i-create-a-new-people-record &quot;Create New People Records&quot;). This will give you an idea of the types of information you can track.
2.  **How can I do that in bulk?**  [Import a list of contacts](/site/knowledgebase/importing-people &quot;Importing People&quot;). It's best to play around with importing people records first because those imports can be deleted. Mess around here before you start entering your previous donations or show records. Artful.ly allows for [3 types of imports](/site/knowledgebase/imports-demystified &quot;Imports Demystified&quot;): People Records, Donation History and Event Attendance.
3.  **How can I learn more about them?** Once you have some records in your CRM, play around with [Advanced Search](/site/knowledgebase/advanced-search-and-list-segments &quot;Advanced Search &quot;) and create a List Segment or two. List segments are great for targeting specific types of patrons.
4.  **How can I talk to my patrons?** [Set up MailChimp](/site/knowledgebase/what-is-mailchimp-and-why-should-i-use-it &quot;What is MailChimp and Why Should I Use It&quot;). With the MailChimp kit activated you can send beautifully designed emails to your patrons and those communications automatically log in your [Action Feed](/site/knowledgebase/actions-the-action-feed &quot;Action Feed&quot;). Take those list segments and reach out to your biggest fans.

		<field name="title">As a sponsored project, what can I do with Artful.ly?</field>
		<field name="content">##Artful.ly is business software for artists.
You can use it to sell tickets to your events, take donations online, and keep track of your fans and patrons. We've built some special features just for fiscally sponsored projects. To access these, you will connect your Artful.ly account to your fiscal sponsorship. ([Learn how to do that here.](/site/knowledgebase/connect-your-sponsored-project-and-artful-ly-account))

##Build a Patron Database From Your Donor History.
When you connect your Artful.ly account to your fiscally sponsored project, your donation records and contact information automatically synchronize to Artful.ly. In addition, any grants or donations to your project from institutional funders appear as Company Records in your database.

You can add notes about donations, details about donors, and see that information alongside ticket sales and communication records. This will help you stay in touch with your patrons, keep them updated on your events, and track your biggest supporters.

##Sell tickets
Having control of ticket sales is an important step in growing your business. Artful.ly allows you to sell tickets for your events in advance and accept credit cards at minimal cost to you:

Online tickets include a $2 service fee paid by the patron, and credit card transactions include a merchant fee of 3.5%, which is automatically deducted from each sale. 

The 7% fiscal sponsorship fee does not apply to ticket sales. To set up your paid ticketing kit, we need a completed [EFT form](https://www.artfullyhq.com/forms/artfully_etf_sign_up.pdf) emailed or faxed to us along with copy of a voided check. 

**Please Note: **It is not currently possible for fiscally sponsored project to sell tax deductible or partially deductible tickets through Artful.ly (or any other ticketing platform). [Show your support for this feature in our Feature Request Forum here.](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/feature_request_view?id=271) In the meantime, you may use the giving levels on your sponsored project page to offer tickets as a perk to donors. Contact the fiscal sponsorship team for more details at support@fracturedatlas.org.

##Take Donations on Your Website
The majority of funding for arts organizations comes from individual donations. As a sponsored project using Artful.ly, you can solicit tax-deductible donations for the purpose of your project without directing your patrons off your website.

To do this, you need either the [donation widget](/site/knowledgebase/what-is-the-widget-and-how-does-it-work) or [WordPress plugin](/site/knowledgebase/installing-using-the-wordpress-plugin) installed on your website. You'll need to know a bit of web programming to install the widget but what you'll get is a elegant way to receive donations. Donations received through Artful.ly will be automatically placed in your sponsored fund and kept separate from your ticket revenue, which gets sent directly to your bank account.

		<field name="title">As a sponsored project, can I sell tax-deductible tickets with Artful.ly? </field>
		<field name="content">**Short Answer:**

No.

**Long Answer:**

Donations to fiscally sponsored projects that come through Artful.ly are deposited in your sponsored fund and released to you when you submit a documented request. But with Artful.ly, ticket revenue goes directly to your bank account so we do not have the opportunity to oversee and approve the way you spend these funds. If we can't monitor how the funds are both collected and spent, than we can't give your patrons a tax-receipt.

This logic applies to memberships and passes too. The revenue for those also goes directly to your bank account so we can't issue tax-receipts for those sales either.

However, a patron may add a fully tax-deductible donation on top of a ticket purchase. Those donations go directly to your sponsored fund and are charged the 7% fiscal sponsorship fee.

We do plan to build features that allow sponsored projects to sell partially-deductible tickets, memberships, and passes. We just haven't gotten to that yet. If this is important to your organization, make your voice heard by [adding a vote for this in our feature request forum](https://artfully.zendesk.com/entries/21620351-Allow-fiscally-sponsored-projects-to-sell-tax-deductible-tickets-memberships-and-passes).</field>

		<field name="title">Five Steps to Producing a Successful Artful.ly Event </field>
		<field name="content"> Here's a quick checklist of things to do and think about as you produce your event.

##1. Ticketing Set Up
*  **Activate the Paid Event Ticketing Kit.** If you want to charge for tickets, make sure we've activated it for you *before* you fill out the Event Details and Show information. It will save you from potentially having to backtrack and start over with your pricing information. [Here's how to do that if you need to](/site/knowledgebase/editing-ticket-information-for-existing-shows).
*   **Set your [capacity and ticket Availability](/site/knowledgebase/ticket-types-capacity).** Make sure you accurately set your capacity before publishing your event. Otherwise, your ticket availability might show up incorrectly (or not at all) on the Event Storefront where people buy tickets.

*   **Add descriptions to your Ticket Types:** Use this to communicate important details about checking in at the event, purchase policies, event disclaimers, or specific price point perks to your patrons. Patrons will see this text in their [Order Confirmation emails](/site/knowledgebase/what-do-receipts-look-like).

##2. Event Promotion
*   **[Familiarize yourself with your Artful.ly storefronts](/site/knowledgebase/sell-tickets-via-central-storefront-and-event-storefront):** This is where people will go to find out more about your event and buy tickets.
*   **[Install The Artful.ly Widget](/site/knowledgebase/what-is-the-widget-and-how-does-it-work)** if you are interested in selling tickets from within your own site.
*   **Tell people about it!** Whether you use the Central Storefront link or link to a page on your website&amp;mdash;put that link everywhere people will find it and buy tickets: Emails, social media, website, postcards, posters, text messages.... everywhere! 

##3. Use the Box Office to Sell Tickets
*   **Grow your audience:** Get the names of people who show up at the last minute to buy tickets&amp;mdash;[Use the Box Office!](/site/knowledgebase/box-office-sell-tickets-at-the-door)

**This is how you'll build your database of patrons. Its probably the most useful thing you can do to expand your network of support to the people you don't already know.**

*   **Manage your internal sales and comps:** You can also sell tickets over the phone and issue comps for each show though the [Sales Console](/site/knowledgebase/sales-console-a-private-sales-channel-for-complex-orders) and for a particular show through the [Box Office](/site/knowledgebase/box-office-sell-tickets-at-the-door). 

##4. Check Your Patrons In
*   **Use the Door List: **Each time you check the box next to a person's name a &quot;Went&quot; action will be logged on their record. This helps you track who actually showed up for future reference. If you just printed out the list, you can go back and do this after the event to make sure this information gets logged.
*   **The Door List App:** We've released an app to the iOS app store to help check in patrons right from an iPhone&amp;mdash;[check it out!](/site/knowledgebase/the-artful-ly-app-door-list-for-your-iphone-or-ipod-touch)

##5. Post Event Follow Up
*   **Say thank you:** Since you've tracked all of your ticket sales, and checked people in from the Door List, you can now [Search and Segment](/site/knowledgebase/advanced-search-and-list-segments) all the people who came to say thanks and continue the relationship  
    
*   **Track patrons:** Using advanced search, you can [make tags and log notes](/site/knowledgebase/how-can-i-use-tags) on records of specific people who bought tickets. It might help you target your communication to them for your next production and future outreach
*   **Plan for your next event:** using that same list of people who attended your last event- you can quickly make sure that your audience gets invited to the next one.</field>

Linking Artful.ly to your fiscal sponsorship allows you to accept donations to your sponsored fund in addition to ticketing events. Connecting the account imports your donation history and donor records received through Fractured Atlas. Once this information is in your Artful.ly account you can manage your contacts and keep track of patrons.

1.  Navigate to your **Account Administration** page.  

 ![Account Administration](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=1 &quot;Account Administration&quot;) 

2.  Find the section labeled Fractured Atlas and select **connect now**.

##   Access To Donation History And Donor Records

*   If your Sponsored Project is **active**, your donation history and donor information will sync with your Artful.ly account. This information is visible in your [Orders](/site/knowledgebase/transaction-history-sales-and-contributions). Donation information is synced once per hour, so any new donations processed by Fractured Atlas will reflect in your Artful.ly account.
*   Donor information will create[People Records](/site/knowledgebase/how-do-i-create-a-new-people-record). You can edit this information within Artful.ly for your records, and you can even export it. 
*   Institutional giving imports as [Company Records.](/site/knowledgebase/company-records) This includes monetary gifts, grants, and in-kind donations from any organization.
*   If your project is **terminated, expired, **or** frozen**, your donation history and donor information will be imported into Artful.ly but you will have to re-activate your fiscally sponsored project to receive new donations through Artful.ly. Contact [support@fracturedatlas.org](mailto:support@fracturedatlas.org) with any fiscal sponsorship questions.
*   **Note: Any changes made through Artful.ly will not be reflected in your donation history on your My Fiscal Sponsorship page, nor will it effect any tax receipts issued. If you need to correct or change any information for tax purposes contact [support@fracturedatlas.org](mailto:support@fracturedatlas.org)**

##   Accept Donations Through Artful.ly

*   Donations made to sponsored projects using Artful.ly process through Fractured Atlas. Tax receipts are issued  per the[ Fiscal Sponsorship Program guidelines](http://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/). Donations processed for Fiscally Sponsored Projects are still subject to the 7% administrative fee assessed for donations. Donations in Artful.ly can only be made by credit card.
*   You can receive donations either through an event Storefront or on your own website with a [widget](/site/knowledgebase/what-is-the-widget-and-how-does-it-work) for donations only or a combined event/donation widget. Embedding widgets on your site means your donors and patrons never have to leave your site to make those transactions!
*   Only **fully deductible donations** where no goods or services have been provided to the donor can be accepted through Artful.ly at this time. Partially deductible donations are planned for a [future update.](/site/knowledgebase/feature-development-roadmap &quot;Feature Development Roadmap&quot;)

##  Ticketing through Artful.ly

*   All ticketing income is **earned revenue** because the funds go directly to your bank account. This revenue is not deductible through the Fiscal Sponsorship Program.
*   In order to opt into the Paid Ticketing Kit you'll need to send a copy of the completed the [EFT Form](https://www.artful.ly/forms/artfully_etf_sign_up.pdf) along with a copy of voided check to [support@artful.ly](mailto:support@artful.ly) or fax it to 815-366-8174. **Note: If you already have EFT information on file with Fractured Atlas for your project you will still need to submit a new form for Artful.ly. Our EFT service requires this.**
*   Once an Artful.ly admin approves your Paid Event Ticketing Kit, you'll receive a confirmation via email and will be able to set-up a paid event.

		<field name="title">Who are my patrons and why should I track them in Artful.ly?</field>
		<field name="content">##Who are your patrons?
**Patrons are your fans and supporters.** Their support comes from all directions: from attending your shows, giving you money, donating time, sharing your posts and tweets, talking about your work, pats on the back, etc. How do you keep track of it? Artful.ly can simplify and centralize that process so you can reach out and get to know the people who help make your work possible.

##Why should you track patrons in Artful.ly?
**People who support you one way are often willing to give to you in other ways&amp;mdash;if you ask. **If you know who came to your last show you'll already have a great list of people to invite to your next one. Or when you ask for a donation to support creating new work or ongoing projects. Or when you ask to spread the word to their friends. Since they are already familiar with you and your work, odds are they'll donate, continue to come to your shows, promote you in their social circles, etc.

**Think beyond family and friends.** Your good friends, and a few family members all came to your last show. Of course they did, they love you and think you're awesome. But what about all those people who showed up at the door. Who were they? Did you get their names? Do they love you too? Could they love you in time?

There's only one way to find out:   

##Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
Artful.ly's [CRM Tools](/site/knowledgebase/what-is-a-crm-and-why-do-i-need-one) take all of these people and allow you to track each interaction they have with your organization and art.

**Interactions Automatically Tracked by Artful.ly:**
*   [When fan buys a ticket online](/site/knowledgebase/sell-tickets-via-central-storefront-and-event-storefront)
*   When a supporter makes a donation online, both for [fiscally sponsored projects](/site/knowledgebase/connect-your-sponsored-project-and-artful-ly-account) and [501(c)(3) organizations](/site/knowledgebase/enabling-donations-for-501-c-3-nonprofits)
*   [When you sell a ticket to a fan at the door using Artful.ly's Box Office interface](/site/knowledgebase/box-office-sell-tickets-at-the-door)
*   When you sell a ticket over the phone using the [Sales Console](/site/knowledgebase/sales-console-a-private-sales-channel-for-complex-orders)
*   [When a fan receives an email sent from your synced MailChimp account](/site/knowledgebase/connecting-your-artful-ly-mailchimp-accountsy)

**Interactions You Can Log Manually in Artful.ly:**
*   [When you made a phone call, sent mail, sent an email, or sent/received other communications](/site/knowledgebase/actions-the-action-feed)
*   [Mailing address, email address, phone numbers, and birthdays](/site/knowledgebase/people-records-overview)
*   [Notes on individual fan's interests](/site/knowledgebase/notes-on-people-records)
*   [Volunteer hours](/site/knowledgebase/people-records-overview)
*   [Donations made offline (Only for 501(c)(3) organizations)](/site/knowledgebase/artful-ly-donation-management-tips)

**Information You Can Import:**
*   [Import  people](/site/knowledgebase/importing-people) from other contact lists (email address books, paper mailing list sign-ups, website/blog subscriber lists, etc.)
*   [Import past event attendance](/site/knowledgebase/importing-events) (for events not ticketed through Artful.ly)
*   [Import donations (only for 501(c)(3) organizations)](/site/knowledgebase/importing-donations) (for donations not processed through Artful.ly)
  
If you import all of this information into your Artful.ly account&amp;mdash;the next time these people make a donation, or attend an event, or do either of those for the first time, Artful.ly will track it automatically provided that they use the same email address listed in their [People Record](/site/knowledgebase/people-records-overview).

##Who should be in my CRM?
1.  Lists from other email marketing tools 
2.  Past mailing lists for postcards or solicitation letters
3.  Select contacts from your personal email account ([Here's how to get them from Gmail](/site/knowledgebase/how-do-i-get-my-gmail-contacts-into-artful-ly))
4.  Donors (for 501(c)(3) organizations)&amp;mdash;[Importing Donations](/site/knowledgebase/importing-donations)
5.  Post event attendanees&amp;mdash;[Importing Events](/site/knowledgebase/importing-events)
6.  Exports from past CRM or databases
7.  Your press list (Tip: add a &quot;Press&quot; tag to their records)
8.  Your donor prospect lists (Tip: tag them all with &quot;Prospect&quot;)
9.  Your vendors (Tip: tag them all with &quot;Vendor&quot;)
10.  Artists you work with regularly (Tip: tag them all with &quot;Artist&quot;)
11.  Board members (Tip: tag them all with &quot;Board&quot;)
12.  Volunteers (Tip: tag them all with &quot;Volunteer&quot;)

Make sure you [format these lists properly so they import into Artful.ly nicely](/site/knowledgebase/importing-people).

		<field name="content">We know software vocabulary can be confusing, so we've created this glossary to clarify matters. If there is a word or phrase you think we should add, let us know in the comments section below!

## 501(c)(3) Donations Kit

**The Charity Donation kit allows 501(c)3 organizations to accept credit card donations through Artful.ly.**  All credit card transactions processed through Artful.ly, including donations, are subject to a 3.5% credit card fee. Fractured Atlas Sponsored Projects use the **Sponsored Donations Kit**.

## Actions

**Actions are any and all contact between your Organization and a patron.** Types of Actions include: ticket purchases (Get), donations (Give), communications (Hear). Every Artful.ly processed Action (ticket purchases and donations) is logged on that patron's People Record. You can also add Give and Hear Actions on an individual's People Record.

## Company

**Companies are a type of People Record. There are five sub-types of Company Records--Business, Foundation, Government, Nonprofit, and Other.** You may assign contact info, actions, etc. to any Company record just as you would to an Individual record.

## Dashboard

**Your Dashboard is the first page you see after you've signed in and your home base for account management.** It includes information about your Events, your Organization, and Recent Activity on your account.

## Events

**Events are a &quot;run&quot; of Shows.** For example, if you are putting on a production of Hamlet for one week, the entire week would consist of the &quot;Event.&quot; The performance that happens at 8PM on Thursday would be a Show. Please refer to the definition of &quot;Show&quot;.

## Individual

**Individuals are your ticket buyers, donors, patrons, customers, clients, etc.** Each individual record will include actions, contact info, etc.&lt;/div&gt;

## Kits

**Kits are sets of features on the Artful.ly platform.** When you sign up, you automatically get the Free Event Ticketing kit and the People Management kit. You can opt into the Paid Event Ticketing kit, and either the 501(c)(3) Donations or the Sponsored Donation kits.

## Notes

**Notes are pieces of information you can leave for reference on a People Record.** They are best used for recording observations about a patron, their preferences, or bits of prospect research.

## On Sale/ Off Sale

**When you are managing tickets for a specific Show, you have the option to change the availability status of each Ticket Type.** If you &quot;Put on sale&quot; the tickets in that type are visible and patrons can buy them on the Storefront or widget. If you &quot;Take off sale&quot; the tickets in that type are visible but patrons who attempt to buy those those tickets will be told they are not available. On sale/ off sale status only applied to the Ticket Type status and is not the same as published or unpublished which applies to the whole Show.

## Paid Event Ticketing Kit

**The Paid Event Ticketing kit allows you to charge for tickets online.** To activate this kit you need to provide us with some banking details so we can electronically transfer your money to you. When you sell paid tickets through Artful.ly, your ticket buyers pay a $2 fee per ticket. That's the only fee from us! When you receive payment for a Show, 3.5% will be deducted for the credit card processing company. 

## People Records

**People records come in two types, Individual and Company.** Each individual has his or her own People Record. 

## Publish/Unpublish

**Publish is how you make tickets for a Show available for people to buy online.** When you first create a Show have the option to click &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Save and Publish.&quot;  If you save and publish, the Show will be visible to the public on your Storefront and the ticketing widget if you choose to use it. If you just save the Show it will default to unpublished status and will not be visible on either the Storefront or the widget. You can publish or unpublish a show at any time from the Shows overview page.

## Reports

**Reports summarize how well a Show has done and what payments are owed to you.** You can also find importing and exporting features under the Reports tab on the top Artful.ly menu.

## Show

**A Show is an individual instance of an Event**. A single performance, screening, showing, etc. For example, if you are putting on a production of Macbeth all week, the Event consists of the entire week. The Show, however, is what happens on Friday at 8PM.

## Settlements

**Settlements are a kind of Report that details the fund transfers from Artful.ly to your bank account.** Transfers are made 2 business days after your show has occurred or after the donation has been made. You can view Settlements under the &quot;Report&quot; tab.

## Sponsored Donation Kit

**The Sponsored Donation Kit gives Fractured Atlas Fiscally Sponsored Projects the ability to accept credit card donations through Artful.ly.** All donation rules and protocols for Fiscally Sponsored Projects apply. [Learn more about Artful.ly for Fiscally Sponsored Projects here](https://artfully.zendesk.com/entries/21293527-artful-ly-101-for-fractured-atlas-fiscally-sponsored-projects).

## Statements

**Statements are a type of report that details the ticket sales and attendance for a single Show.** You can view Statements under the &quot;Reports&quot; tab.

## Storefront

**A Storefront is a publicly viewable webpage that is automatically created for each of your Events**. Each Storefront has a unique URL that you can share with people so they can buy tickets for your Event. You can change the content of your Storefronts by editing the Details on your Event page.

## Ticket Type

**A Ticket Type defines the price and features of each kind of ticket you want to offer to an Event**. Common Ticket Types include General Admission, Student Tickets, Balcony, VIP, etc. You can name a Ticket Type anything you want and set the price and capacity to meet your needs. Ticket Types can be set for an Event under the Event Details tab. You can also edit the Ticket Types offered at a specific Show under the Shows tab.

## Transactions

**Transactions is  where you will find a list of all the Sales and a list of all the Contributions processed through Artful.ly for your organization.** You can search within either Sales or Contributions or both. 

## Vertical Bar

## Widget

		<field name="content">*   **Revenue from Artful.ly transfers directly to your bank account.** Because the money goes to you and not Fractured Atlas, ticket sales, memberships, and passes are not tax-deductible and do not count towards your grant eligibility requirement.  

    We plan to build features to sell tax-deductible tickets, memberships, and passes. If you want these features for your organization, please make sure to vote for it in our feature request forum: [Allow Fiscally Sponsored Projects to Sell Tax Deductible Tickets, Memberships, and Passes](/site/knowledgebase/feature_request_view?id=271).  

*   **Fully tax-deductible donations may be made in addition to a ticket sale**. Your patrons have the option to donate to your project at checkout. Those donations go directly to your sponsored fund just like any other donation.  

    Fiscally sponsored projects may also use the [Artful.ly Widget](/site/knowledgebase/what-is-the-widget-and-how-does-it-work) or [Wordpress Plugin](/site/knowledgebase/installing-using-the-wordpress-plugin) to take donations directly on their sites.  

*   **Funds from events ticketed through Artful.ly arrive in your bank account 7-10 business days after each show. **Artful.ly settles funds from ticket sales two business days after each show in your event, but your bank can take another 5-7 business to process those funds and post them your account.</field>

Fractured Atlas's fiscal sponsorship program is also non-exclusive; it's fine with us if you want to be sponsored both by us and someone else. If you decide to pursue a second sponsorship, check with your sponsor about their policies. You might also ask your sponsor if they can send you donation records in a CSV. You can then import the information into Artful.ly and keep donations and ticket sales records all in one place.

## Some Examples

**A Ticket Sale:** A ticket to your production of Hamlet costs $15\. A ticket buyer uses her Visa to buy a ticket through Artful.ly and is charged $17\. We keep $2 of that. Visa charges 3.5% of the $15 - that's $.053\. In the end, you receive $14.47.

**A $0 Ticket Sale:** A ticket for your New Works Reading costs $0\. A ticket buyer does not have to give credit card info to reserve that ticket online. She is not charged anything--no $2 service fee. You will receive $0.

**A Mixed Ticket Sale:** You're charging $5 for Adult tickets and $0 for Child tickets. The patron buys one of each and pays $5 +$2 = $7\. You will receive $4.83.

**A Donation to a 501(c)(3):** A friend can't make it to your production of Hamlet but decides to make a $100 donation to your organization online. His MasterCard is charged $100\. There is a 3.5% processing fee on that transaction. You get $96.50.

Importing a list of patrons from Excel or an old database might take 10 minutes or an hour depending on how many patrons you have.

Creating a new event for ticketing could take roughly 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the number of price points or ticket types you want to offer. Finally, putting the transaction widget on your site takes maybe 15 minutes if you're familiar with JavaScript.

		<field name="title">Writing &amp; Formatting Knowledge Base Articles (CC)</field>
		<field name="content">Writing and formatting articles for the public Knowledge Base and the Internal Knowledge Base work basically the same way...

### Article Titles
- **Choose a question or a statement.** Compose article titles that are either:
  - A statement that uses [title case capitalization](http://titlecase.com) (eg. Feature Development Roadmap)
  - A question with standard sentence capitalization (eg. Do I have to sign a contract?)
- **65 characters or less.** This keep titles to one line and makes browsing easier. 
- **Save the slugs!** The first time you save an article, the title will become part of the URL for that article. If you edit the article title, a new URL will be created, but the original URL will still exist and redirect to the new URL. Saving URL &quot;slugs&quot; like this helps prevent broken links.
- **Two articles can have the same title,** an extra dash will just be added to the end of the second article's slug. Avoid giving the same name to two articles if possible though since it could confuse members.

### Content Tips
- **Use Fractured Atlas voice and tone.** The [Fractured Atlas Brand Book](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qs6ToC9NsAqV1ZN9ZLyS4WX7GWkRo40BMdbIF1fN9FE) details the appropriate voice and tone for customer communications. For Knowledge Base articles, the goal is to communicate process-based information to users who need help with a task. The audience is a combination of members and prospective members. The tone should be straightforward and simple. Users are looking to get something done. Use humor sparingly.
- **Keep articles short.** Long articles are intimidating and confusing. Consider breaking one long article into two. (This article is very bad example of this principle.) On the other hand, browsing a bunch of articles that are just one sentence answers is annoying. Try to strike a balance and aim for a word count of about 100-500.
- **Number steps.** Break processes down into discrete steps and number those steps.
- **Explain the logic** behind a step if doing so clarifies the process. If it doesn't help, don't waste the reader's time.
- **Use screenshots.** Not every step needs an image, but one per key step is helpful.

### Formatting Article Content
Markdown is the text formatting syntax used in our KB. Many of the basic formatting styles can be applied with the nifty Markdown toolbar at the top of the Content editing field. If you're feeling fancy, dig into a Markdown cheat sheet like this one and learn some new tricks. Here are some basic formatting tips:

- **Unordered lists** or bulleted lists should be used when the order of the items does not matter. To create a unordered list, highlight the text and click the toolbar icon with four rows. 
- **Ordered lists** or numbered lists should be used when the order of the items is important, such as describing steps of a process. To create a numbered list, highlight the text and click the toolbar icon with three rows. Do not manually number lists.
- **Nested lists** are lists with multiple levels or tiers. To create them:
  - First create a basic list.
  - To indent a line, add two spaces before the dash to indent to the second level.
    - Additional levels are created by adding two more spaces before a dash.
    - Open this article in edit mode to see what the markdown looks like here.
- **Quote** is a toolbar button for creating off-set block quotes. 
- **Code** is a tool bar button that allows you to display code without rendering it. You probably won't ever use this in public-facing articles, but there's an example of this for the em dash below.
- **Em dash** can be created with this code: `&amp;mdash;`This will not render properly in preview mode, but you'll see it once you save the article. 
- **Line breaks** often to not translate from the editing view to the published view. To ensure a line break, add two spaces after the final punctuation mark before your line break.
- **Anchor links** may be possible in Markdown, but it would require some pretty involved HTML. You're welcome to experiment.
- **Preview.** Make sure to check your formatting by clicking the &quot;Preview&quot; button, then flip back to continue editing. When you are done writing, double check the formatting from the public-facing side of the KB.

### Links
- **Embed a link.** Highlight the relevant text, click the link button in the toolbar, and enter the URL address. 
- **Use relative links.** When linking to any page on www.fracturedatlas.org (including other KB articles, feature request threads, or images in the asset library) use relative links. To do this, omit all of the characters before the first slash. For example, if you want to link to the staff page, just enter &quot;/site/bios/staff&quot;. This helps maintain fast and consistent navigation within our own site.
- **Email address links** can be formatted like so: `[text you want someone to see](mailto:email@emailaddress.none)`
- **Use HTML for links to open in a new tab.** When you want a link to open in a new tab, for example any page or download link (such as a hosted PDF file) outside of www.fracturedatlas.org, use this HTML formatting: `&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.createbirmingham.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Create Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;`

### Arranging Articles
- **Define one category per article.** This will determine where the article appears. (Eventually, we will be able to put articles in more than one category, but we need to change the way position ranking works before that will work well.)
- **Organize articles with position numbers** within a category by defining a numerical position of each article. In the &quot;Position&quot; field, enter a digit. The articles with the smallest position numbers will appear at the top of the category and those with the largest at the bottom. If you don’t enter a position number, the article will default to the top of the list.
- **Space position numbers by 10s**. Give yourself spaces to add space to add additional articles in the future by initially assigning positions in increments of ten. So your first article has position 10, your second is 20, third is 30, and so on. Then, when you want to insert an article that is second from the top, you can give it position 15 and save yourself the trouble of renumbering all the subsequent articles. You can have two articles in the same position but the order will be random so space them out.
- **Ignore tags.** When viewing an article in agent browse mode, you may see a field for tags. We haven't set that up yet. Just ignore it for now.

### Publishing
- **Publish.** When the article is all ready to go, check the box next to &quot;Publish&quot; on the top right the bottom and then click the &quot;Save.&quot; Now the article will appear on the public-facing Knowledgebase. You can unpublish at any time. 
- **Draft.** Articles that do not have the publish box checked, are considered to be in a draft state. You can see &quot;draft&quot; tags on articles in the articles list view.

### Migrating Articles Into KB
- **Converting HTML to Markdown is easy.** Try [this tool.](https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown)
- **Convert Word to Markdown is trickier.** We tried a couple options, but for now the best bet is to convert the Word text to plain text, paste that in to the KB, and reformat there. Sorry.
- **Check it!** Be sure to glance over the Markdown code that you copy and paste from the converter. Sometimes the transition can add errors such as an extra line break, asterisk, span, or div. Just delete those.

		<field name="title">What should I look for in a quote?</field>
		<field name="content">You just received a quote. Congratulations! Now that you have a quote in hand, it's time to figure out whether or not it will meet your needs. When evaluating your quote, you'll want to ask these questions:

- **What is the premium to purchase this policy?** The premium is the total cost of your coverage, so of course you'll want to know what it is before making your purchase.

- **What are the limits of this policy?** A limit of insurance is the maximum amount your policy will pay out in the event of a claim. There are a few important types of limits to know:
  - *Per occurrence*- This is the maximum amount that your policy will pay out for any one event.
  - *General aggregate*- This is the maximum amount your policy will pay out throughout the entire policy term.
    - Note: it's common to see both per occurrence and general aggregate limits on liability insurance policies. For example, a common limit pairing is $1 million per occurrence and $2 million general aggregate.

- **Is there a deductible on this policy?** A deductible is an amount you must pay out of pocket before your insurance coverage can &quot;kick in.&quot; For instance, you might have a $500 deductible on your equipment insurance policy, meaning that when you lose your $5,000 camera, you will need to pay for the first $500 before the insurance company can pay out the remaining $4,500 loss.

- **Does this policy include additional insured coverage?** Entities like the venues and organizations you work with will often require that you list them as additional insured on your policy. This means that they will be covered under your policy for the operations you conduct in relationship with them. When checking your quote, you'll want to see either that the policy lists the specific additional insureds you've requested, or that it includes *blanket additional insured coverage*&amp;mdash;that is, coverage for an unlimited number of additional insureds.

- **What is the coverage territory on this policy?** Some policies are valid worldwide, others are valid anywhere in the United States, many are specific to the locations you've listed on your application, and some are even specific to the physical address listed on your application. Make sure you know where you need to be covered, and double check that the quote you receive will extend to to those locations.

**I've taken a good look at my quote, but I still have questions. Help!** Feel free to ask us any remaining questions about your quote by replying to the quote notification email. We'll get right back to you with answers.

		<field name="title">What happens if you can't get me a quote?</field>
		<field name="content">Unfortunately, there are times when none of the carriers we work with are able to provide quotes. This happens for a number of reasons, but there are a few recurring themes: it is often difficult for carriers to insure music videos, aerial work, rap/hip-hop/heavy metal concerts, and other activities that they view as high-risk. 

Please be assured that Fractured Atlas will do everything we can to find you a quote. We make a point to consult all available insurance carriers before we determine that a quote cannot be issued. In the event that we cannot provide a quote, however, we are also happy to refer you to a number of outside insurance resources, which may be able to help find the coverage you're looking for. Just ask, and we'll look into some alternative options.</field>

		<field name="title">Annual General Liability Insurance</field>
		<field name="content">**What is annual general liability insurance?**
It's a year-long policy that covers you against lawsuits that might be brought against you because of damage to rented spaces/locations, injury to spectators or innocent bystanders, etc.

**How much does it cost?**
That depends on a lot of things, including what you do and where you are located. The minimum quote for annual general liability is $425, and it just goes up from there. Things that can make it more expensive are: location (some cities and states are more expensive than others because they're &quot;more risky&quot;), number of events, number of spectators, and total payroll.

**What is the territory?**
US and Canada. For international operations, you will need a separate International Liability policy.

**Can I apply for International Liability Insurance?**
Yes. Please include a detailed description of your international activities in your application and our broker will pursue an international quote. 

**Is there a deductible?**
Nope!

**What are the limits?**
$1 million per occurrence; $2 or $3 million aggregate (that's the total that the insurance company will pay out) depending on the carrier; $1 million personal and advertising injury; $2 or $3 million products and completed operations depending on the carrier.

**What can be insured under these policies?**
Almost anything, as long as it's arts-related.

		<field name="content">**What is Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance?**
Directors' and officers' liability insurance (D&amp;O) offers your individual directors (high-level staff of organizations) and officers (board members) the protection they need from personal liability and financial loss arising out of wrongful acts committed in their capacity as officers and/or directors. Example: If the executive director of an organization runs off with the company's money, this would cover the board members and other high-level staff if they were sued. One can also elect to include Employment Practices coverage as well, which covers things like sexual harassment, discrimination, and wrongful termination suits.

**How much does it cost?**
The minimum premium is $650 and it goes up from there.

**Is there a deductible?**
There is a $2500 deductible on certain claims.

**What are the limits?**
The general aggregate on this insurance is $1,000,000.

**What can be insured?**
Nonprofit arts organizations and fiscally sponsored projects

**What isn't insured?**
For-profit arts organizations.

		<field name="title">Event Insurance</field>
		<field name="content">**What is event liability insurance?**
It's short-term liability insurance that covers you against claims related to damage to the venue and injury to spectators or innocent bystanders.

**Do event liability policies automatically provide workers' comp insurance?**
No, that's a separate policy that has its own application.

**Do we need liquor liability?**
Probably not, which is good because it's really expensive! The only time you need liquor liability coverage is if you are selling the alcohol and retaining the money that you make. If that's the case, you also need a liquor license (and we'll need a copy of it) and someone with your event needs to complete a specific online intervention training program (which we also need proof of). Event insurance already includes some liquor coverage that is everything you need if you're giving the alcohol away.

**Does this policy include performer coverage?**
No. If you're doing an Equity showcase or have volunteer performers you'll need to get a volunteer accident policy, which is different coverage. If you have performers you are paying then you may want to look into a workers compensation policy.

**How much does it cost?**
Every event is different, but the minimum is approximately $400 and as always, it can go up from there.

**Is there a deductible?**
No, not on the liability insurance policies.

**What are the limits?**
Generally, $3 million aggregate (the total that the insurance company will pay out); $1 million each occurrence; $1 million personal and advertising injury; $3 million products and completed operations. This can vary based on each policy, but these are the typical limits for the event insurance program.

**What can be insured under these policies?**
All sorts of things, as long as they're artistic! We've done plays, musicals, dance, opera, music, gallery openings, film screenings, poetry readings, gala fundraisers, music festivals, the list goes on!

**What if my event is in lots of venues or is really long?**
That's fine! But if you have lots of things going on throughout the year, you'll probably be better off with an annual policy.

**What isn't insured under these policies?**
Events held in a private home, or anything that is not artistic. We can't do weddings.

Film production is an annual general liability policy that will cover you for your filmmaking activities (regardless of location, as long as you are in the US) for an entire year. Equipment insurance is a policy that will cover loss, damage, theft, etc. to your rented or owned equipment.

**How much does it cost?**
They're always different, but the minimum cost of the film general liability is $500 and the equipment is $750. As always, it can just go up from there.

**Is there a deductible?**
On the general liability, no! On the equipment, yes! It's usually $1000, but it's higher for some losses like by earthquake or hail.

**What are the limits?**
$2 million general aggregate (the total that the insurance company will pay out); $1 million per occurrence; $1 million personal and advertising injury. The equipment insurance covers however much equipment value you request on the original application.

**What can be insured under these policies?**
Film or video production! Just so you know, music videos are difficult and we can't do pornography.

It's liability coverage that protects you against claims for damage to a location or injury to a spectator or innocent bystander during fabrication, installation, and exhibition.

They start at $425 for the liability insurance and can go up from there.

		<field name="content">**What is volunteer accident insurance?**
Volunteer accident insurance provides annual insurance to cover accidental medical expenses for volunteer employees who are injured while on the job, as well as coverage for accidental death and dismemberment. This can be used to cover volunteer performers (including those in Equity Showcase performances and in films with unpaid SAG actors) or for any volunteer that is working under your auspices as an artist or arts organization. A volunteer is defined as someone who is an unpaid worker (or someone who is being paid via a stipend reimbursing them for their direct expenses) and who is not on payroll/salary.

**Can you obtain volunteer accident insurance for any state?**
Absolutely. This policy covers volunteers in all states.

**How much does it cost?**
We have a free quote estimator on our Volunteer Accident page.

**Is there a deductible?**
Yes! Usually there's a $250 deductible.

**What are the limits?**
Up to $500,000 (aggregate) of coverage per accident, with $50,000 in primary accident medical expense available immediately per volunteer per accident. For certain accidents, including those involving automobiles, the medical expense limit may differ. There is a $25,000 limit (principal sum) for Accidental Death and Dismemberment.

**What can be insured?**
Any arts-related organization or artist with volunteer workers.

**What isn't insured?**
Paid workers: you'll need a workers' compensation policy for that. 

Injury due to aerialist activities cannot be covered under our Volunteer Accident program.

The policy also has standard exclusions, including the following: Owned Aircraft, Leased Aircraft, Operated Aircraft, Aircraft Pilot or Crew, Disease or Illness, Service in the Armed Forces, Specialized Aviation, Suicide or Intentional Injury, War. Please contact the Fractured Atlas staff for more details.

It's coverage for paid employees in case they are injured on the job. Workers' comp pays medical bills before an individual's health insurance kicks in. Have volunteers? Check out our volunteer accident policy instead.

**Am I guaranteed to get a Workers’ Compensation quote?**
Unfortunately, no. We're always willing to try to get you coverage, but it's been increasingly difficult to get quotes for performers without a relatively high payroll. We also can't get quotes for North Dakota, Ohio, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Because of state laws, workers' comp in those states has to be purchased through a state agency.

**How much does it cost?**
It's always different! It depends on what state, how many employees, how much payroll, even what exactly you are doing. We can tell you that the minimum quote we've received so far, for an organization with very little payroll and just a few employees, is about $400.

In Artful.ly, an &quot;Event&quot; is a run, and &quot;Shows&quot; are the individual instances of the performances or showings. To sell tickets to anything, you first need to create an event. To add a new event, follow these steps.

1.  Under Events, select **New Event**.
2.  Enter the the name of the event you are organizing and name of the venue where it is being held. Click **Create Event**.
3.  You will then be directed through a series of pages to help you flesh out your &quot;Event Details.&quot; Fill in each field based on what you want your patrons to know about your event, how to contact you, and your ticketing options.
4.  The first Event Details page is called **About.** Fill in the the event name, event subtitle (if applicable), name of the producer, description, and contact information for your patrons. **Save &amp; Next**
5.  On the **Venue** page, complete information about the location of the Event. Here, you have the option to show or hide the Google map on your Storefront. Click **Save &amp; Next**.
6.  On the **Prices** page, set the overall **Capacity** for the event. Then, define your **Ticket Types**. Each Ticket Type includes a ticket type name, an optional description of that ticket, a price, and an option to limit the number of tickets of that type that you want to sell within the event capacity. Click **Save &amp; Next**. (You will be able to adjust the capacity and ticket types available for each show later in the set up process.) See the screenshot below to better understand the relationship between Capacity and Ticket Types.
7.  On the **Image** page, you can add an image that will appear on your Storefront and as a visual key for this event throughout your Artful.ly account. Click **Save &amp; Next**.
8.  On the **Messages** page, you have the option to create a question to ask your patrons during their checkout process. Often this field is used to ask patrons things like &quot;Please tell us the names of your guests,&quot; &quot;Do you have any special seating requests?&quot; or &quot;Would you prefer chicken or fish?&quot; Click **Save &amp; Next**.

## **Next Step: Create Shows**
Now that you've set up information about the run of your event, you need to create &quot;Shows&quot; for each instance or performance of the event. [Learn how to set up shows here.](/site/knowledgebase/creating-shows-)

		<field name="content">## What are 'Events' and 'Shows'?

**In Artful.ly, an &quot;event&quot; is a run and &quot;shows&quot; are the individual instances of the performance or showings.** To sell tickets to anything, you first need to [create an event](/site/knowledgebase/creating-an-event). Once you've done that, you can add shows to your event.

## Show Set Up: Times, Dates, Capacity, and Prices 
To Add Shows:
1.  Select the event for which you want to add an show.  
2.  Select **Shows** from the side menu.
3.  Click on **Add shows**:

  ![Add New Show](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=17 &quot;add new show&quot;)

##Add Show Times and Show Dates
1. **Show Time**:Select a start time.

2. **Show Dates**: Click on all the dates in Calendar that you have shows for the time you just selected.

  **If your event has Shows at multiple times, repeat steps 4 and 5 until all the Show Times and Show Dates are accounted for in the Calendar.**

  ![Add Shows](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=20 &quot;Add Shows&quot;)

##Capacity and Prices
Whatever **Capacity** and **Ticket Types** you set up under **Event Details &gt; Prices** will default to the individual Shows you set up. However, if you need to tweak capacity and price points per show—or add new Ticket Types for specific Shows—this is where you can do that.

* **Capacity**: sets how many overall tickets for Show you have available to sell.
* **Ticket Types** : allow you to Name different types of tickets, set a variety of Price Points, Ticket Limits, and Availabilty. 
*   **Name**:Appears to Patrons as the Type of Ticket they are purchasing.
*   **Ticket Type Limit**:The amount of Tickets available to sell at this Price Point for this Show. If it doesn't matter how many you sell at this price, **leave it blank.** This does not limit the amount of tickets one person can buy at a time. To do that you can use [Discount Codes](/site/knowledgebase/discount-codes) or sell this Ticket Type offline through the [Box Office](/site/knowledgebase/box-office-sell-tickets-at-the-door).
*   **Description**:Use this text to inform Patrons about what this type of Ticket means or includes.
*   **Storefront &amp; Widgets**: Available for purchase online.
*   **Box Office**: Available to sell manually, over the phone, or in person.

  ![Ticket Capacity Details](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=21 &quot;Ticket Capacity Details&quot;)

##Save and Publish

**Save** puts tickets on sale through the Box Office. **Save and Publish **puts tickets on sale both through the Box Office and to the public online.        

             **Your show will not be visible in the storefront unless you publish it.**

  Important: If your ticket types are unique to different show times (not dates) go through steps 4-8 for each start time.

## Editing Show Details
To Publish, Unpublish, or Duplicate shows:

1.  Go to the **Shows** menu.
2.  Click on **List.**  
 
  ![List View Detail](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=19 &quot;list view detail&quot;)
 
3.  Click the gear button next to the show's time to publish, unpublish, put tickets on sale or take tickets off sale. 

  ![List View Menu Detail](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=22 &quot;List View Menu Detail&quot;)

## Changing Ticket Type Information, Capacity, or Availability
1.  Repeat steps 1 and 2.
2.  Click on the Show you want to edit—this will open up the **Show Details** page.

		<field name="title">What is MailChimp and why should I use it?</field>
		<field name="content">MailChimp was built by some smart folks in Atlanta, Georgia, not by Fractured Atlas or Artful.ly. Here's why we really like them and why we think you will too.

## What is MailChimp?

MailChimp is a web-based email marketing service. It helps you design email newsletters, share them on social networks, integrate with services you already use, and track your results.

## Why do I need a special tool for email marketing?

Technically, you can send a newsletter or announcements about your upcoming shows via your personal email. Email providers like Gmail, Hotmail, and Outlook, however, are designed for one person to send one email to just a couple people at once--not a whole list of fans. That's a different kind of task achieved more efficiently, effectively, and professionally with a different tool. Here are a few reasons why an email marketing service like MailChimp is a better tool for this kind of task:

*   **Approved bulk mailer.** Most email services and Internet service providers (ISP) limit the number of emails you can send at one time. This is to prevent spamming. With a tool like MailChimp, you can send an email to an unlimited number of recipients at one time.   
*   **Greater deliverability.** Services like MailChimp work with ISPs and corporate domains to ensure your emails are recognized as safe and approved. If there is a problem with delivery, MailChimp will attempt to re-send the email and tell you why an email might be bouncing.
*   **Adherence** **to privacy laws.** Bulk mailers are required by law to include an unsubscribe link in every email. MailChimp and other email marketing services include this automatically and ask recipients why they are removing themselves from your list.
*   **Professional styling.** MailChimp offers a wide variety of customizable templates for designing polished emails. You can also build a template from scratch to use with MailChimp.
*   **Compatible with various email readers and devices.** MailChimp gives your recipients the option to read your emails in fully-styled HTML or text only. They can also click a link to read the email in a web browser instead of their email. Also, did you know that over 50% of emails are now opened up on mobile devices, and this number is only growing? MailChimp also provides you with tools to see how your email campaign looks on a smart phone and other mobile devices. 
*   **Know if people are reading your emails.** If you send an email through your personal email, you have no idea who opened it. Email marketing tools give you all sorts of fun analytics on successful deliveries and open rates so you know your fans are listening.

## Other Cool Things MailChimp Does:

*   **Divide your lists into groups.**  Dividing your fan-base in sub-groups based on engagement, location, social stats and more, allows you to tailor your message to the people reading it. [Read more about grouping MailChimp lists here](http://mailchimp.com/features/segmentation-and-groups/).
*   **Install a sign-up form on your website.** Customize the fields you require and embed the HTML on your site. MailChimp also helps you easily send fans to your sign up form via URL, Twitter, Facebook, and QR code. [Read more about forms here.](http://mailchimp.com/features/custom-forms/)
*   **Click Maps.** Check out the screenshot below. It's from the MailChimp report the thank you letter Fractured Atlas sent to event attendees. I see the majority of readers clicked the Facebook album link. I can even dig deeper and see which of our newsletter subscribers clicked that link. This information tells me which stories appeal to whom and where I could improve my email next time.  [Read more about click maps and other reporting here.](http://mailchimp.com/features/reports-overview/)
*   **[Browse the MailChimp Features Overview.](http://mailchimp.com/features/)**

![MailChimp Click Report](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=646 &quot;MailChimp Click Report&quot;)

## How much does MailChimp cost?

MailChimp offers a variety of different plans. Read about it all on their [pricing page](http://mailchimp.com/pricing/), but here's our short version:

*   **Forever Free.** As long as you've got fewer than 2,000 subscribers across all lists in your account, you can send up to 12,000 emails per month without paying a dime. So if you've got 1,999 subscribers you can email them all six times a month. (And really, only your mother wants to hear from you more than that.) They don't even ask for a credit card. 
*   **Monthly Plans.** You can upgrade to a paid plan if you don't want limits on the number of emails you send a month. Unlimited email plans start at $10 for 500 subscribers and go up from there.
*   **Pay As You Go.** If you’re not a frequent sender, you can purchase credits that work like stamps for email. Buy them when you need them. Starting at $0.03 per email and decreasing in price as your volume increases.

## Why MailChimp and not ConstantContact, Verticle Response, MadMimi, etc?

Because....

*   ...we like MailChimp's clean, intuative interface and powerful tools.
*   ...their pricing is fair.
*   ...a lot of artists and arts groups use and like MailChimp already. (We use MailChimp ourselves for Artful.ly and Fractured Atlas enews)
*   ...they offer an API that makes it easy to integrate our tools with theirs.
*   ...they are friendly and nice to work with.

MailChimp was our first pick, but someday we may offer integration with other email marketing tools. Got one you really love that we should consider? Tell us in our [Feature Requests Forum.](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/feature_request_list?topic=Artful.ly)

&lt;span&gt;You can access event and show statements from two different paths:&lt;/span&gt;

1.  From the top menu bar, select **Reports**, then **Statements**, then choose the event.

 ![Event Statements List](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=799 &quot;Event Statements List&quot;)
 
2.  From a Show Details page, click **View Complete Settlement** as shown below.

 ![Statement Link](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=31 &quot;Statement Link&quot;)

3. Then, either click on an individual show date, or select **Generate Report** to view the statement for the entire run of shows in the event.

## What's on a statement?

### Revenue Overview 

(In the screenshot at the bottom of this article, these numbers are in the gray box.)

*   **Tickets Sold** = Sum of the number of tickets sold. This number does not include comp tickets.
*   **Gross** = Total price paid for tickets sold for this show.
*   **CC Net** = Total revenue from credit card sales processed by Artful.ly minus the 3.5% processing fee. This total what Artful.ly owes you for the show.
*   **Settled** = Amount of money Artful.ly has paid you for the show. This will be $0 until until your [settlement](/site/knowledgebase/settlement-reports) has been initiated (2 business days after the show has played). After that, this value should be equal to the CC Net value.

### Breakdown by Payment Method

For each method of payment—credit card, cash, comp--sales are broken out in the follow columns:

*   **Tickets** = Number of tickets purchased with the given payment method.
*   **Gross** = Total price of all tickets paid for with the given payment method.
*   **Processing** = Total fees paid to Artful.ly for credit card sales only. Equal to 3.5% of gross of credit card sales.
*   **Net** = Net revenue for given payment method. For credit card sales this is gross minus 3.5% processing. Should be equal to CC Net in the top bar. 

### Breakdown by Purchase Location

Artful.ly tickets may be sold in a number of locations. This table helps you see where your sales are happening.

*   **Web** = Total number of tickets purchased via the Artful.ly Storefront, widget, and WordPress plugin.
*   **Box Office** = Total number of tickets purchased through the box office interface.
*   **Artful.ly** = Comp Tickets manually entered by you.
*   (The columns in this table are the same as the payment method columns defined above.)

### Breakdown by Discount

If you have created any discount codes that can be used for this event or show they will be listed as rows in this table. Columns across the top are:

*   **Discount Code** = The name of the code.
*   **Type** = The promotion type associate with the code--either &quot;X dollars off&quot; or &quot;buy one get one free&quot;.
*   **Tickets** = Total number of tickets purchased with this code.
*   **Discounted** = Total dollar value of discounts redeemed with this code.

### Slices = Data Visualization

Clicking on the **Slices** button will show you a colored pie chart view for each set of breakdown criteria. This feature has some kinks in it but we thought we'd roll it out now so you can play around with it. :)

		<field name="title">What is &quot;open source&quot; and why should I care?</field>
		<field name="content">When software is “open source”, that means it is free to download, including the underlying software code, and that anyone is allowed to modify it to suit their own needs. This is in contrast to most commercial software products, which cost money to license and which can’t be modified by the end user. Advocates of open source software (including us!) argue that it results in better quality code, increased reliability, greater flexibility, a lower total cost of ownership, and freedom from predatory vendor lock-in.

Artful.ly has been fully open source from day one, but we didn’t stop there. We’re aiming for radical transparency at all stages from design to distribution. Since the earliest requirement gathering phases, we’ve used community design sessions to hear from our colleagues in the arts community. The Artful.ly Open Source Edition code and documentation are free and publicly available, so anyone is free to build custom implementations, or to extend it with new modules or features.

This matters to Artful.ly because there’s a positive feedback loop between the two sister projects. As we (and others) continue to improve the Artful.ly Open Source Edition code base, those enhancements will be integrated into Artful.ly. Likewise, if we develop something really cool for Artful.ly, we’ll almost always incorporate it into the open source code.

		<field name="title">Ticket Types &amp; Capacity</field>
		<field name="content">## Ticket Set-Up
**Ticket Capacity** is the total number of seats in your venue, or rather, the maximum number of people you can sell tickets to. 

With **Ticket Type Limits, **you can control how many tickets are available to sell at each price point. Every ticket sold will be subtracted from the remaining capacity amount so that you don't oversell your show.

![Prices and Ticket Capacities](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=692 &quot;ticket type &amp; capacity&quot;)

## An Example
Let's say your theater has exactly 100 seats. Your town fire marshal loves to do surprise inspections, so you don't want to oversell. On the other hand, you've got actors to pay so you'd like to fill every seat. You set the total ticket capacity to 100.  

You're offering four different ticket types—General Admission, Student, Senior, and VIP. You don't care what the distribution of GA, Student, and Senior tickets are so you don't put any limits on those. The VIP tickets come with a free puppy. You only have 10 puppies so you limit the number of VIP tickets to 10.  

Now the hard cap is at 100 for the whole show; you can sell up to 10 VIP tickets; Students, Seniors, and General Admission folks all have a fair shot at a seat; and you haven't ticked-off the fire marshal. Take a bow.

		<field name="content">**Artful.ly comes in two flavors...  

1. Hosted Artful.ly
2. Artful.ly Open Source Edition

Here's how they compare:

**Hosted Artful.ly**

- Best for independent artists and small arts organizations.
- You want a system that's ready to go.
- The code is what powers the your experience but stays behind the scenes.
- It lives on the cloud, so you can access it anywhere on the Internet.
- Set up costs NOTHING!
- Set up time is 10 minutes.

**Artful.ly Open Source Edition**

- Best for mid-sized arts organizations.
- You want a system with a lot of customization.
- The code is the framework of what you want to build.
- It lives on the server of your choice.
- Set up costs $$ because you'll need to hire a software developer, but the base code is free.
- Set up time is a few months.

Artful.ly is one version of arts management software created with Artful.ly Open Source Edition, but there are many more possibilities. If you like to play with code, you can create a customized version of Artful.ly.

		<field name="content">## Why did you build Artful.ly?

**We decided that we could build something better than the other ticketing and CRM tools already available.** Way back in 2011, many of Fractured Atlas's 35,000 member artists and arts groups weren't happy with their options. Over the years we've built several bits of software to manage our own business, and with our knowledge of arts and technology, Artful.ly was a natural next step.

Artful.ly was made to be different. It lets you sell tickets on your own site, it integrates sales and donations in one customer record, and it's more nimble and customizable than other systems. There are no licensing fees just to keep the system running and no contracts to sign. 

And that's just the beginning. We engage with artists and arts organizations who use our software. We encourage both ticket-buyers and ticket-sellers to suggest new features, and we allow everyone to vote on features they like most. Fractured Atlas's goal is to help the artistic community, and Artful.ly is one step to fulfilling that goal.

##Q: I changed information on the Prices page but it's not changing my Storefront—why?
**A:** Short answer: You probably updated the prices in your Event Details, but you have a show scheduled on the calendar with the old information.

Longer answer: Event Details functions like a template for any new show you create. If you've already created a Show(s) for your Event, changes to Ticket Types on the &quot;Prices&quot; page (price, description, or capacity) will not update existing Shows. New shows, however, will reflect the information in your updated Event Details.

You can either delete the Shows and then make changes to Ticket Types in **Event Details**, or change the Ticket Types for each **Show** separately. 

  ![Edit Tickets Why and Where](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=36 &quot;Edit Tickets Why and Where&quot;)

##Q: How do I add tickets for my show?
**A**: Let's suppose your show is in such high demand that you added floor seating, thus increasing the overall capacity of the show.

1.  Select the Show you are adding tickets to.
2.  Add ticket to the overall **Capacity** for the show.
3.  Add Tickets to the **Ticket Type **you want to update or create using the gear button as shown below.
4.  Include any limitations to that particular **Ticket Type** if needed.

![Add Tickets](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=37 &quot;Add Tickets&quot;)

##Q: How do I add a whole new Ticket Type to a show I've already created?   
**A** **Example**: You want to create some last minute buzz by adding a new discounted Ticket Type.

1.  Open the shows menu and select **List**.
2.  Select a date you want to add the ticket type to.  
    ![select show date](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=644 &quot;Select show date&quot;)
3.  Select the **Add New Ticket Type** button.
  ![add new ticket type](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=645 &quot;add new ticket type&quot;)
4.  Name the Ticket Type, and add Description, Price, and Limits accordingly.
5.  Depending on the type of ticket, you may choose to have it for sale only at the door or in advance. (You may need to scroll through the window to see the visibility options.  
6.  Save! This will automatically put the new tickets on sale for this show and make them available in your Storefront and Widget.
7.  Repeat for each show in this event that you need to add new ticket types to.

 ![Add Ticket Types](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=694 &quot;Add New Ticket Types&quot;)

Scroll though this menu and you'll find the ticket type visibility checkboxes, which change where the tickets will appear. 
  - **Storefront &amp; Widgets** This checkbox makes your tickets available for your fans to buy in the storefront or in a widget on your site. These are the self-service sales channels. 
  - **Box Office &amp; Sales Console** Check this to make the tickets sellable through your staff-managed sales channels. Think over-the-phone and door sales.
  - **Members** This applies only to organizations running the memberships kit. Checking this box makes a ticket visible in the member storefront. If you have a ticket type you want to be seen only by your members, check this box.
 
 ![Change Ticket Type Visibility](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=695 &quot;Ticket Type Visibility Checkbox&quot;)
 

## Q: Why does the software work like this?
**A:** Because it allows greater flexibility in your show pricing.  Remember that an **Event** is the entire run of a production, while the **Show** is an individual occurrence of that production. In other words, an Event can happen over a week or month, but a Show happens on a specific day at a specific time. 

When you start a new production, the **Ticket Types **you set in Event Details auto-populate for each Show you create for that Event. This is because we want to make your life easy.

BUT Shows will not automatically update with new information unless you update each Show separately. We designed it this way so that you can charge different prices for different Shows but not affect the prices of the entire Event. This allows you to, for example, charge different prices for the same section on weekends, or drop the price on a slow night without affecting the overall Event pricing.

*   Which dinner option would you prefer: Chicken, Beef, or Vegan?
*   Where did you hear about this event?
*   Please provide the names for your guests.
*   List any questions you have for the panel.
*   What shows of ours have you seen before?

		<field name="content">It's not ideal, but sometimes shows get cancelled or need to be rescheduled, and tickets may need to be exchanged or refunded.The important thing is to act as quickly as possible and inform your ticket buyers right away. You'll perform the same steps whether you need to cancel a show or just change the time. It's not possible to change the time of a show, but you can delete or unpublish the show and add a new one to the calendar.
 
## If you haven't sold any tickets, unpublish the show/s.
This is the simplest solution. If no one bought tickets, then nothing needs to be returned. All you need to do is remove the show from the public view. 

1.  Select the Event.
2.  From the left side menu, select **Shows**, then **List**.
3.  In the table, find the show you want to cancel, click the &quot;Unpublish&quot; button.

  ![Unpublish Show](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=44 &quot;Unpublish Show&quot;)

## If you have already sold tickets to the show, you can either:

1.  Refund the tickets.
2.  Or, exchange tickets for a different or rescheduled show. Note that if the show date has passed the tickets cannot be exchanged. We suggest comping people tickets to the other show if you move them to another night. 

**Detailed information on how to refund and exchange tickets can be found here:**

*   [Refund, Exchange, or Return Tickets](/site/knowledgebase/refund-exchange-and-return-tickets)

**Here are some more helpful tips to make sure your cancellation goes smoothly:**
  *   Communicate with your ticket buyers ASAP. The sooner they know of a cancellation, the happier they will be.
  *   If you are rescheduling, set up the new show as soon as you have a date so you can exchange tickets.
  *   If you have sold tickets, tell your ticket buyers the show is cancelled and _provide refunds or exchanges before two business days after the show closes._ This is particularly important because if you don't refund tickets in time, the show settlement will be processed and you will have distribute refunds outside of Artful.ly (check reimbursements, etc).
  *   Update your storefront links if you delete the entire event, and not just a showtime.

## What Your Fans See

Once you have created and published your event, Artful.ly will automatically create a public Event Storefront. This page is where you can send fans to buy tickets. Here's an example of what an Event Storefront looks like with a free event:  

   ![Little Apple Storefront](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=52 &quot;Little Apple Storefront&quot;)

Fans can add tickets to their card and proceed to check out. When they check out, fans will see that they're completing an order for a $0.00 ticket.   

   ![Little Apple Checkout](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=50 &quot;Little Apple Checkout&quot;)

## Email Order Confirmation

Once your fan has checked out, he/she will receive a confirmation email for their order. This confirmation will include the event and ticket details.

**A: **You can delete a show if you have not sold any tickets to it.

1.  Go to the **Shows Menu**.
2.  Open up the show you want to delete from either the **Calendar** or **List** view of existing shows.
3.  In the Show Details section at the top, click on the **Work With** button and choose **Delete**.

  ![delete_show](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=56 &quot;Delete a Show Date&quot;)

**Note**: If you've already sold tickets to the show and want to hide tickets from public view, you can** Unpublish** the show instead so that no one else can purchase tickets online.

**A: You can delete an event only if you have not sold any tickets to any show within it**.(That includes free or comped tickets.) After you have sold a ticket, you can't delete the event. This is to prevent accidentally deleting an event that people have already bought tickets to and make sure the bookkeeping stays tidy.

As long as no tickets have been sold, a **Delete This Event** button will be available on the bottom of the **Event Overview **page. Click on the name of an event to reach its overview page.  Or from in individual show you can click Event Overview on the left-hand side.

		<field name="title">Can I change the layout of my Artful.ly storefront?</field>
		<field name="content">*The short answer is no.* The content of the Storefront is completely in your control, but there is just one standard layout that includes the following information:

*   The event name
*   The event subtitle
*   The name of the producer (usually your organization's name)
*   Show dates and times with a drop down ticket selector for each performance
*   An about section with your description of the event and the image you uploaded
*   The venue name, address, and a thumbnail Google map
*   Contact information for questions about tickets or the event itself


Here's an example of what a storefront looks like after you enter in all that information:

  ![Twelfth Night Storefront Example](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=620 &quot;Storefront Example&quot;)

* If your event has more than five shows, the Storefront layout will shift from a bar per show to a calendar with your show dates in blue. This makes the view less cluttered.

* If you want to customize the page where your patrons buy tickets, you should use the [Artful.ly Widget](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/what-is-the-widget-and-how-does-it-work).

		<field name="content">**Knowing who's not coming to an event can be just as important as knowing who is. This article suggests how to track all of your RSVP's so that you can:**

*   Track who invitees who cannot attend
*   Follow-up with invitees who have not yet responded

## Step 1: Set Total Ticket Capacity

You can use Artful.ly to collect both &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; responses to event invitations by creating &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; ticket types. To do this, you will need to set a total capacity number that includes both &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; responses.  Set capacity to at least the number of invitations you will send and pad that with a few extras.

**Example**: If you have room for 45 people and invited 60, you should set capacity to 60 to allow for 60 total RSVP's.

  ![Event_Capacity](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=60 &quot;set your event capacity&quot;)

## Step 2: Create Ticket Type for Attendees

Next, create a ticket type for the invitees who will attend, or a &quot;yes&quot; RSVP. You can name this ticket type whatever you like--we're just calling it &quot;yes&quot; to explain the idea here. Set the **Ticket Type Limit** to the real capacity of your venue. 

  ![RSVP_yes_ticket_type](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=61 &quot;RSVP yes ticket type&quot;)

## Step 3: Create Ticket Type for Declined Invitations

Create a ticket type for the guests who cannot attend. We are calling this the &quot;RSVP No&quot; for this example, but you can name this ticket type whatever you want. Just make sure to leave the **Ticket Type Limit **field blank for this ticket type.  This will allow you to collect as many  RSVPs as you could potentially get.

Use the Description field to clarify what the &quot;RSVP No&quot; ticket type means to your invitees. These invitees will still receive an order confirmation email which could be confusing without this text. 

  ![RSVP_no_ticket_type](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=62 &quot;rsvp no ticket type&quot;)

## Step 4: Get More Info at Checkout (optional)

If you'd like to automatically track reasons for not attending, try using the [Special Instructions](/site/knowledgebase/ask-fans-a-question-at-checkout) option to ask a question on the patron's checkout screen. You can also use this field to ask guests who are attending if they have special seating requests, or what the names of their guests are.

  ![cannot_attend_message](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=63 &quot;cannot attend message&quot;)

## Step 5: Track Responses via Door List

On the **Show Details** page for each date of your event you'll be able to oversee how your RSVP's are coming in for each response. 

  ![rsvp_tracking](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=65 &quot;rsvp tracking&quot;)

* The number available will tell you how many RSVP's (both &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; have yet to be claimed)

* The number sold from the &quot;Yes&quot; ticket type will tell you how many people have said &quot;yes.&quot;

* The number sold from the &quot;No&quot; ticket type will tell you how many people have said &quot;no.&quot;

## Organize Responses for Targeted Communication:

Use the Door List to quickly see who is not coming to your event and who is. You can download the list and organize the data in the spreadsheet by ticket type to see this organize this information more at a glance. You might then choose to send different follow up emails to the folks who can attend verses the ones who can't. 

  ![Door_list](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=66 &quot;door list&quot;)

  ![Door_list_csv](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=68 &quot;door list csv&quot;)

 * You can also compare this spreadsheet with your initial invitation list to quickly deduce who hasn't responded. Follow up with them too!

		<field name="title">How can I set up pay-what-you-want ticketing?</field>
		<field name="content">Artful.ly does not yet offer specific features for Pay-What-You-Want ticketing. But there is a workaround.

##Pay-What-You-Want Workaround  
When creating an event in Artful.ly, you must set the overall capacity for your venue. Then you have the options to create an unlimited number of ticket types with different prices.

Depending on the general scale of your event, you can create a separate ticket type for each price point you'd like to offer as an option. So, if your venue holds 100 people and you'd like to offer tickets at a range of prices, select 100 as your capacity, then create individual ticket types for each price and leave the 'limit' blank. For instance, if you are hosting a small chamber music performance, you might offer tickets at $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $15, $20, $25, or $50.

You can create multiple ticket types during event creation here:

  ![Creating Multiple Ticket Types](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=69 &quot;creating multiple ticket types&quot;)

**Once you've created your ticket types, you can see the overview of everything you have to offer in the show details.**

There will also be an option to create even MORE ticket types if you so choose:

  ![pay_what_you_want_overview](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=70 &quot;an overview of all the ticket types&quot;)

Note that tickets in the Storefront will display from most expensive on top to least expensive on bottom. 

Here's an example of what the patrons will see in the Storefront:

  ![pay_what_you_want_storefront](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=71 &quot;pay what you want storefront&quot;)

		<field name="content">## What does this kit do?

With the Scannable Tickets Kit enabled, when your patron buy tickets their order confirmation will come with a PDF file attachment that has images of each of the tickets in their order (see below). Patrons can print these tickets at home and take it to your show to be scanned with the [Artful.ly iOS app](/site/knowledgebase/the-artful-ly-app-scan-tickets-with-your-iphone-or-ipod-touch).

  ![ticket_example](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=72 &quot;ticket example&quot;)

## What does this kit not do?

Currently, Artful.ly does not offer the following features...

*   Bulk printing a batch of tickets and hand them out in a will call scenario.
*   Allowing a ticket buyer to send his ticket to Passbook or open in a dedicated app.

If these features are a priority for you, please tell us in the [Feature Request Forum](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/feature_request_list?topic=Artful.ly).

## Activating The Scannable Ticking Kit

It is recommended you activate this kit for a show that you have not sold tickets for, yet. Turning on the kit in the middle of a run could cause confusion when patrons arrive at the door--those who bought tickets before you turned the kit on would not have printed tickets and those who bought tickets after you turned the kit on would have printed tickets. You don't need any more nuttiness just before a performance.

To turn on the kit:

1.  Navigate to your **Account Administration** page by navigating to the top menu and clicking on your email address.
2.  Under **Kits**, click the **Add** button next to **Scannable Tickets**.  

    ![add scannable tickets kit](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=74 &quot;scannable tickets kit add button&quot;)  
3.  Click the green **Activate Scannable Tickets** button.

		<field name="title">Sales Channels Explained</field>
		<field name="content">There are five channels through which tickets may be sold in Artful.ly. Some channels are public where your fans can buy tickets directly, and some are private and only accessible to you and the approved users on your account.

1.  Event Storefront (public)
2.  Event Widget/WordPress Plugin (public)
4.  Event Box Office (private)
5.  Sales Console (private)

You can use all of these or just a couple. No matter what channels you use, all tickets come from the same pool so you don't need to allocate a certain number of tickets to a given channel.

##Event Storefront

**The storefront is a public facing URL that you can share with your patrons, it displays upcoming shows.** Patrons can select the show they'd like to attend and check out using a credit card.

1.  To find the event storefront, either select **Event Overview** or **Share &amp; Sell** from the side menu on an event page.  

     ![Storefront Links](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=75 &quot;storefront link&quot;)

2.  Select **Storefront** to view the URL. You can use this URL in your ticket promotion materials or link to it from your site or other promotion outlets.

  ![Winters_Tale_Storefront_Sales_Channel](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=76 &quot;storefront&quot;)

## Event Widget

**The Artful.ly widget enables you to take donations and sell tickets directly from your own website.** A sleek shopping cart will appear on your web page when someone clicks “Buy” or “Donate.” Using the widget requires a certain level of coding knowledge.If you aren't familiar with web programming, save yourself some trouble and use the storefront.

For instructions on how to set up the Artful.ly Widget, [see this article.](/site/knowledgebase/what-is-the-widget-and-how-does-it-work)

  ![Widget_generator](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=78 &quot;widget generator&quot;)

## WordPress Plugin

**The event plugin works on websites that use WordPress as a content management system.** Like the widget, the Artful.ly plugin enables patrons to donate and purchase tickets directly from your website. If your site is hosted on wordpress.com and not on a domain you own, you cannot use this plugin.

[Click here](/site/knowledgebase/installing-using-the-wordpress-plugin &quot;Installing &amp; Using the WordPress Plugin&quot;) to learn more about the plugin and view installation instructions.

  ![plugin](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=79 &quot;plugin&quot;)

## Event Box Office

**The Box Office is a private sales channel you and your staff can use to sell tickets at the door or over the phone.** It also provides easy access to your Door List to check in patrons as they arrive. There are no ticket fees applied to Box Office sales. You only pay the credit card processing fee if you sell tickets via card.

Check out [this article](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/box-office-sell-tickets-at-the-door &quot;Box Office: Sell Tickets at the Door&quot;) for more information about the Box Office and selling tickets at the door.

  ![gettingtoboxoffice](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=80 &quot;getting to the Box Office&quot;)

## Sales Console

**The Sales Console is another private sales channel that you and your staff can use to build orders for your patrons.** This is ideal for orders that involve more than just tickets. You combine tickets, discounts, memberships, passes, and donations and process the whole order in one transaction.

For more information about selling tickets with the sales console, [review this article](/site/knowledgebase/sales-console-a-private-sales-channel-for-complex-orders).

## Make sure you have ticket types.
By default, Artful.ly will have a &quot;General Admission&quot; ticket type. The ticket type names can be changed and more ticket types can be added in **Event Details** under **Prices**. You can see more about this in [Setting Up an Event](/site/knowledgebase/creating-an-event &quot;Setting Up an Event&quot;).

## Make sure your event has a capacity.

In your **Event Details** under **Prices** you need to set the capacity of your venue. This puts a limit on the number of tickets you can sell so you don't oversell and keep the fire marshal happy.

 ![ticket capacity](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=85 &quot;ticket capacity&quot;)

## Are your tickets visible in the Storefront, Widget, or Box Office?

Sometimes you may need to set up a ticket type that you need to keep private. You can choose which ticket types are visible in the public **Storefront** and which are only visible in the private **Box Office** with the check boxes for your ticket types. 

 ![ticketvisibility1](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=87 &quot;ticketvisibility&quot;)

## Have you requested the Paid Event Ticketing Kit?

It takes approximately 1-2 business days to activate a Paid Event Ticketing Kit. To request the kit, have your Organization Administrator go to the **Account Administration Page** and press  **Add** for the kit you want to use.

If you have multiple events running simultaneously, you can share your **Central Storefront** with your patrons. This storefront that displays every upcoming event you have scheduled. You can find the link under** Account Administration **in the upper-right corner of the page. By default the URL is your Organization Name, but you can customize it using the **Edit** button on the left side of the page.

   ![account admin5](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=91 &quot;account admin&quot;)

If you have multiple events running in the same time period, you can share your **Central Storefront** with your patrons. Any events with upcoming shows scheduled will be visible here. Your Central Storefront link includes your organization's name, so it's also good for printed materials. 

![Central Storefront View](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=513 &quot;central storefront&quot;)

Clicking a **Buy Tickets** button will take you to that event's storefront.

## Event Storefront

If you want to promote just one event at a time, find the link in your event's **Share and Sell** menu.

![Event Storefront Link](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=514 &quot;event storefront link&quot;)

That link will send patrons directly to that specific event's storefront.

## 1. Storefront: Fans choose the show they want to buy tickets for

  ![checkout 2](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=99 &quot;checkout pt 2&quot;)

  _Note: If you are excited about discount codes, but don't know how to set them up, read this: [Creating Discount Codes](/site/knowledgebase/discount-codes)._

## Optional Custom Checkout Questions
When you add a [question at checkout](/site/knowledgebase/ask-patrons-a-question-at-checkout), the question or disclaimer appears to ticket buyers during the checkout process as **Special Instructions** right before they complete their purchase.

## For 501(c)(3)'s, patrons can add special instructions for their donation

Nonprofit organizations with the 501(c)(3) Donations kit activated, you can configure it so that patrons making a donation can add instructions for that donation at checkout. This allows for patrons do note things such as &quot;This gift is in honor of Harold Pearson.&quot; 

![Donation special instructions field](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=571 &quot;Donation special instructions field&quot;)

## 3. Confirmation: Patrons see a confirmation screen and get an email from Artful.ly
  ![order_confirmation](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=100 &quot;order confirmation&quot;)

## Widget Checkout
Checkout with a widget is similar to checkout with a Storefront. See example widgets in action here:

*   [https://www.artful.ly/widget-demo-1](https://www.artful.ly/widget-demo-1)
*   [https://www.artful.ly/widget-demo-2](https://www.artful.ly/widget-demo-2)

		<field name="title">Settlement Reports</field>
		<field name="content">## What is a settlement?

**A settlement** is the money Artful.ly owes you for each show or donation.

Each show has one settlement that includes all money you made from credit card sales minus the 3.5% processing fee. Two business days after your show, Artful.ly sends the settlement to the automated clearing house. From there, it takes another few days for them to process the payment and send it to your bank account.  

Each donation has its own settlement. Artful.ly sends donation settlements two business days after the donation is made. From there it takes a few days for the automated clearing house to get it to your bank account.

It is important to keep your bank account info up to date. If the EFT information is no longer accurate and a transaction is returned, there will be a $10 fee per returned settlement.

Note: To generate revenue breakdowns for each show, view [Statement Reports](/site/knowledgebase/show-sales-statements)

## Where do I find my settlements report?

1.  Select **Reports **from the top navigation bar
2.  Choose **Settlements**
3. From there, you can view either previously **Sent** or **Upcoming** settlements by toggling between them.

Here's an example of a settlement report:

 ![Settlements](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=794 &quot;Settlements&quot;)

From the **Show Details** page, you can also view the estimated settlement date and amount. 

  ![Settlement estimate on show details page](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=831 &quot;Settlement estimate on show details page&quot;)

## What do the columns on the report mean? 

**ID:** This is uniquely identifies the settlement within Artful.ly. Click on this and you'll see a list of all the orders included in the settlement.

**Item:** This will be either an Event Name, Donation, Membership, or Pass. 

**Detail:** These column contains either the show date, or the name of the membership type or pass type. This column is blank for donation settlements. Because memberships and passes have the option of having the service fee paid either by the producer or by the patron, we've included one example of each  here.

**Date:** This is the day Artful.ly released the settlement. From this date, it will take the automated clearing house system another 3-5 business days for the funds to reflect in your bank account.

**Gross:**  Total amount of credit card sales for this show or the total amount of the donation.

**Realized:** Total amount received by Artful.ly from patrons for this show. This number should always equal the gross figure.

**Net:** Total amount owed to you for credit card sales after the 3.5% processing fee is deducted. 

## Wait, so when do I get my money?

Funds usually end up in your bank account 7-10 business days after each show closes.

**Example:** Your show played on the evening of Wednesday the 1st. Artful.ly will send the settlement the following Monday the 6th. (Wednesday night = Thursday day in bank-think, so Friday and Monday are the two business days.) You should see the deposit to your bank account anytime between Wednesday the 8th and Friday 10th.

**Bank Holidays** slow the EFT process down. That's why we recommend planning for the entire 7-10 business day window.</field>

		<field name="content">To get a proper notion of how effective and popular your discounts are, you can access a discounts report. It is found under **Reports** in the top menu bar.

## How do I search discounts?

There are three ways to search discounts:

*   By all discounts
*   By an individual discount
*   By a range of dates

Note: If you have used the same code for multiple events, the report will show you all applicable events.

![Discount Codes List](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=104 &quot;Discount Codes List&quot;)

##  What's in the report?

**The report gives you an overview for each discount type and specifics on the individual transactions.** This includes the number of discounts and a break down by the patron and event. It also shows you the original income potential for the tickets, what they earned instead, and the difference. If you would like to export this information you may do so using the 'Download CSV' button.

![Discount Code Report](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=105 &quot;Discount Code Report&quot;)
## Can I get specific discount info for a particular show?

**Discount reports by show are available in each show's complete statement.** You can access this by selecting &quot;Reports&quot; from the top menu bar, then &quot;Statements&quot;, select an event, then select a show. (Or access the same statement report from a show's details page.) This statement will shows you which discounts were used for the chosen show, how many were claimed, and the final price after the discount for each ticket.

 ![modal to add user to your organization](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=598 &quot;add user modal&quot;)

The new user will receive an email inviting him/her to your organization's account. He/she will need to follow the directions in that email to create a Fractured Atlas membership &amp; password in order to log into the account. For access to Artful.ly, a user only needs a free, Community membership.

To edit an existing user's permission levels or email subscriptions:

 ![edit or remove users from permission page](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=748 &quot;edit permission level&quot;)

## Changing The Organization Administrator

To change the Organization Administrator, email the Artful.ly Support Team at support@artful.ly. The email should come from your organization's current org admin and it should include the full name and email address of the new org admin. These requests normally take 1-2 business days to fulfill, and both the original and the new org admin will be notified once the change has been made.

		<field name="content">When you set up paid event ticketing or donations, you send us information to set up [electronic fund transfers](https://www.artful.ly/forms/artfully_etf_sign_up.pdf) (EFT). This allows us to send money directly to your bank account. We send the money for different things at different times:

- **Ticket Revenue.** Artful.ly initiates the settlement two business days after each show takes place. (That way, you don't have to wait for the whole run to be over.)
- **Donations to 501(c)(3) Nonprofits.** Settlements initiate two business days after the contribution is made.
- **Donations for Fiscally Sponsored Projects.** These are sent to your sponsored fund and released when requested as just like any other donation to a sponsored project as described [here.](/site/knowledgebase/when-and-how-do-i-get-my-project-s-funds.)
- **Passes and Memberships.** Settlements initiate two business days after a pass or membership is sold.

From there the money moves through the electronic payment processing system which sends it to your bank account. Typically, you can expect the funds to be deposited in your bank account **7-10 business days after a show date passes or a donation is made.**

## Viewing Past and Upcoming Settlements

To view settlements, go to the **Reports** menu and click on **Settlements**. Toggle between **Sent** and **Upcoming** to view past and pending settlements to your account. When viewing past settlements, use the &quot;Work with...&quot; button to download a CSV.

![Upcoming Settlements](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=794 &quot;Upcoming Settlements&quot;)

Within the settlements table you'll find the following columns for:

- **ID** The order numbers will be hyperlinked to take you to the Order Details page for that transaction.
- **Item** This will either be the name of the event a ticket was purchased for, a donation, or membership or pass sale.
- **Detail** This will detail either the show date, pass type, or membership type.
- **Date** The date the settlement was initiated. It will most likely take your bank 3-5 days to process the funds from the date the settlement was initiated. 
- **Gross** The total amount of funds in the settlement before any service or credit card transaction fees are removed. 
- **Realized** If you have passes and/or memberships set up with the producer paying the service fee, this column shows revenue after service fees for memberships or passes have been deducted. 
- **Net** The final amount settled to your organization. For memberships and passes, this will be the revenue after the credit card processing fees are deducted from the realized column. 

**Note: Artful.ly does not send you deposit notifications. Check your bank's online statement to see if they have posted the funds to your account.** Bank holidays can sometimes delay when a settlement reaches you, so be mindful of shows that happen right before a 3 day weekend. Also, banks can occasionally delay a deposit if it's larger than average for your bank account; it's rare, but can sometimes prolong the settlement period.

		<field name="content">## 1) LEARN ABOUT THEM

## Ask for description of the organization:

*   Name
*   Discipline/s
*   Location/s
*   Self-presenting or presented by others?
*   Do they have their own venue?
*   How many performances (shows) do they have per year?
*   How many tickets do they sell per performance (show)?
*   Are their tickets assigned seating or general admission?

## Gather info on their current systems:

*   Ticketing
*   Online Donations
*   Donor Management
*   Email Marketing
*   Website Content Management System (CMS)

## What other services are they considering?

*   Other ticketing software?
*   Other donor management software?

## 2) TELL THEM ABOUT ARTFUL.LY

## Current Features

*   Ticketing overview
*   Donations overview
*   CRM overview
*   MailChimp overview

## Upcoming Features

*   Memberships
*   Passes
*   Relationships
*   Householding
*   Printable tickets
*   iOS ticket scanner

## Pricing

*   No fees for sign-up or user accounts
*   No license fees
*   We only make money when you do.

*   Tickets = $2/ticket, patron pays. 3.5% credit card fee.
*   Donations = Just 3.5% credit card fee.
*   Memberships = 5% fee per membership. 3.5% credit card fee.

## How It's Made

*   We build what users tell us to.
*   As a nonprofit, we want to keep prices as low as possible for our services. Grant funding pays for the initial development so we don't have to charge fees as high as for profit companies to re-coup those costs.

## 3) MISCELLANY

*   Questions about Artful.ly?
*   Features they want that we don't have yet...

*   Is it part of ATC scope of work? Then it's coming soon.
*   Is it a feature request we've heard before? Then talk about how we prioritize features with lots of votes.
*   Is it something we have a workaround for? Then tell them about that.

*   Outline next steps for them--set up account, organize import data, test it out with a demo account, etc.

## 4) SEND FOLLOW UP EMAIL

*   For any feature requests, vote on their behalf and subscribe them to that thread.
*   Link to relevant articles.
*   If applicable, create an account on Demo for them and send them login credentials.</field>

		<field name="content">I've been scheduling these calls over Join.Me, and hosting the audio over SpacePhone.

## Questions to Ask

*   How did they hear about us? (If they're new.)
*   Do they currently have a subscription program? How do they run it?
*   What systems are they using now?
*   How many shows does the organization present a year?
*   What is their subscriber base like?

## Create a Pass and Make a Show Pass Eligible

*   Create a pass. I use Lorem ipsum as the placeholder text.
*   Detail each field in the pass creation process. 
*   Explain the 5% service fee + 3.5 percent credit card processing fee. With the producer paying you get a nice round price but lower net revenue, and for the patron paying the service fee is added, but the net revenue is higher. (For these demos, I've set the passes and memberships to have the patron pay.)
*   After creating the pass show how a show is made pass-eligible.
*   If the org is an FSP, mention that passes are non-deductible. We want to build them, but it's going to in a later version of Artful.ly.

## Member Storefront

*   Go to Account Administration and talk about customizing the member storefront.
*   Show the Central Member Storefront, but also show how to access the storefronts for individual pass types. You can find these under Sell and Passes. Click the button labeled **Store Link **with a shopping cart next to it.
*   Purchase the pass in the storefront. If Selena is around she may be able to forward you the emails, but don't count on having the confirmation emails as an example. Use the Use Pass Now button from the confirmation page.
*   Purchase a ticket to show you made pass-eligible.

## Show Back End Changes Part 1 - Patron Records

*   Go to a passholder patron record and talk about the new Member identifiers.
*   Click on the passholder tag to go show the pass history.
*   Show how to send a reminder email and show the pass.
*   Click the checkbox next to the pass and talk about the work with options.

## Demo Sales Console

*   At this point I usually navigate to the Sales Console and begin talking about the various tiles.
*   Conduct one regular transaction on the sales console.
*   Mention that for pass sales we are not charging the 5% service fee during the beta, but the 3.5% still applies. Passes and pass-eligible tickets for the same person can't be sold during the same transaction.
*   Instead, show the  producer sell-to to apply a pass code to an order. Demo selling to a passholder and applying the pass code. 
*   Open Advanced Search and search by pass types.

## Conclude

You've gone over:

*   Creating passes
*   Making shows pass-eligible
*   Customizing the Pass Storefront
*   Sales Console
*   Changes to People Records
*   Advanced Search

Send the org copies of the knowledge base articles on passes.</field>

## Questions to Ask

*   How did they hear about us? (If they're new.)
*   Do they currently have a membership constituency? How do they run it?
*   What systems are they using now?
*   What do they offer their members?
*   Are the purely membership based, or is this a membership that runs alongside general ticket sales?

## Create a Membership and a Member Event

*   Explain the difference between rolling and seasonal memberships (If they've been doing memberships already they'll probably know immediately when they see both options.)
*   Show how to set up a membership. I use Lorem ipsum as the placeholder text.
*   Detail each field in the membership creation process. 
*   Explain the 5% service fee + 3.5 percent credit card processing fee. With the producer paying you get a nice round price but lower net revenue, and for the patron paying the service fee is added, but the net revenue is higher. (For these demos, I've set the passes and memberships to have the patron pay.)
*   After creating the membership show the difference between making a member-only event, and member-only ticket types.
*   If the org is an FSP, mention that the memberships are non-deductible. We want to build them, but it's going to in a later version of Artful.ly.

## Member Storefront

*   Go to Account Administration and talk about customizing the member storefront.
*   Show the Central Member Storefront, but also show how to access the storefronts for individual membership types. You can find these under Sell and Memberships. Click the button labeled **Store Link **with a shopping cart next to it.
*   Purchase the membership. If Selena is around she may be able to forward you the emails, but don't count on having the confirmation emails as an example. If you're using Backyard Ensemble you can log in with Sally Fields (people get a good chuckle out of her name)  
    Email: Sfields@example.com  
    Password: password
*   I try to have a member event with Sally's membership Demo Rolling Membership attached to it.
*   Purchase a member ticket.
*   This is the point where it's good to talk about how the organization is going to advertise the membership and how their patrons will be directed to the storefront. Since this is often a behavioral change for their patrons, I recommend linking to the member sign in page from their own website alongside any links to general admission ticket sales. They should probably also do this with email marketing, too. A good example of this is [Boom Arts](http://www.boomarts.org/#current-projects).

## Show Back End Changes Part 1 - Patron Records

*   Go to a member's patron record and talk about the new Member identifiers.
*   Click on the member tag to go show the Member history.
*   Show how to send a member password reset.
*   Click the checkbox next to the membership and talk about the work with options.

## Demo Sales Console

*   At this point I usually navigate to the Sales Console and begin talking about the various tiles.
*   Conduct one regular transaction on the sales console.
*   Mention that for membership sales we are not charging the 5% service fee during the beta, but the 3.5% still applies. Memberships and member tickets for the same person can't be sold during the same transaction.
*   Instead, show them the sell-to feature. Demo selling to a member and adding a member ticket to the cart.

## Back End Changes Part 2 - Advanced Search and Comping Memberships

*   Open advanced search and show membership specific search parameters
*   Talk about searching by Current Lapsed and Past memberships
*   Show how to save a list segment 
*   Discuss exporting lists of members
*   Show how to use an advanced search to comp memberships in bulk. This is especially important for organizations looking to move their existing membership constituency to Artful.ly. Show how you can set a different expiration date and customized message.

## Conclude

You've gone over:

*   Creating memberships
*   Making member shows and tickets
*   Customizing Member Storefront
*   Sales Console
*   Member Login
*   Changes to People Records
*   Advanced Search
*   Comping Memberships

		<field name="content">1. We do not store credit card numbers, even encrypted. These are all stored in our credit card processor's electronic vault. Our servers keep only the last 4 digits and an internal identifier that can be used to re-bill subscription fees or recurring donations. Even that information is only stored as needed (i.e. not in the case of a one-time donation or ticket purchase). No one on staff has the ability to access full credit card numbers. 
2. Passwords are stored in an encrypted format using the most current encryption algorithms, as recommended by security experts. If someone were to steal our entire database, it would still be nearly impossible to crack individual passwords. That said, many people use passwords that are inherently insecure, and there's not a lot we can do about that. 
  - Always use passwords that are at least 8 digits long (10 is better) and contain a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
  - Don't use the same password on every website. 
  - Never share your login credentials with anyone. 
3. Social security and tax id numbers are stored in an encrypted format that would be nearly impossible to crack if the database were compromised.
4. Our office is essentially paperless. No sensitive information is stored on site.</field>

1.  **Deploy the &quot;problem with widget install&quot; macro and get:**
  1.  URL of install page
  2.  CMS they're using (If its wordpress- see below)
  3.  Artful.ly org name 
2.  **For ticketing widget, check that they have Paid Event Ticketing kit activated and published show/s.**
3.  **For donation-only widget, check that they have a donation kit activated.**
4.  **Check for errors in Inspector.**
  1.  Using Chrome, go to their website.
  2.  Right click and select &quot;Inspect element.&quot;
  3.  On the inspector toolbar, select &quot;Console.&quot;
  4.  Check for errors.
  5.  If error says something about &quot;artfully.js&quot; &gt;&gt; Assign ticket to Gary with above info.
  6.  If error exists but doesn't says &quot;artfully.js&quot; &gt;&gt; Tell user error may be conflicting with Artful.ly widget and they should resolve it.
5.  **Check jquery.**
  1.  Using Chrome, go to their website.
  2.  Right click and select &quot;View page source&quot;
  3.  Ctrl+F and search for &quot;jquery&quot;
  4.  If jquery appears in multiple lines &gt;&gt; Tell user to delete pasted code and start again. This time, they should generate widget again but select &quot;Yes&quot; so jquery is not  included in javascript snippet. Re-install new snippet.
  5.  If jquery appears nowhere &gt;&gt; Tell user to delete pasted code and start again. This time, they should generate widget again but select &quot;No or I don't know&quot; so jquery is included in javascript snippet. Re-install new snippet.
  6.  If jquery appears in only one line &gt;&gt; This is not the source of the problem. Assign ticket to Gary with above info.
6.  **If error is not coming from Artful.ly and they use Wordpress**
  1.  If the website is hosted by WP (URL ends w / wordpress.com) the widget will not work.
  2.  If website is not hosted by WP prompt producer to check and make sure that the custom CMS theme they are using supports enough widgets to include Artful.ly. This may be a good reference to point people towards so that they can troubleshoot on their own: [http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets)

		<field name="content">This article describes how admins should follow up with chargeback notifications.

1. Finance Team receives notification of chargeback from BrainTree or directly from a credit card company.
2. Finance Team forwards the notification with due date and other related information to support@artful.ly, which goes into the FA HD.
3. Selena or a PA assigns the ticket to Alessandra (Or, whomever is handling CB's at the time.)
4. PA tracks down the charge either with the name of the patron or the Braintree Transaction ID provided in the email that the finance team receives. (Oftentimes, the latter is what's easiest for finding the charge, since frequently the name on the credit card does not match the name of the person who placed the order.)
5. PA creates new FA HD ticket to email patron with boilerplate message. 
6. PA logs into the Producer's Artful.ly account and re-sends the order confirmation receipt along with their message regarding the dispute.
7. PA responds to finance team confirming that they have reached out to the patron.
8. PA logs the CB in the Google doc [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tf5ANcxZz752IHb48TFW5_z0WApaICAcoRSCdptLvUI/edit#gid=0) (If you do not have access to this document to edit it, please request editing privileges from someone on the finance team.)
9. If customer has not gotten back to their email within 48 hours, PA calls the patron.
10. If patron replies via email: create a PDF of the email thread and send it in original ticket from the finance team. If the patron replies on the phone, request that they respond to your email with a written confirmation that they understand what the charge was for.
11. Finance Team sends the appropriate documentation to the bank, documents status of the CB in the Google Doc.
12. Every month or so, Finance Team will update the Google Doc with the outcome of the dispute. </field>

**Creating custom discounts for individual tickets, **buy-one-get-one**, and group rates is easy with Artful.ly.** You can create unlimited discounts for any event and limit a code to specific show dates and/or ticket types. Discount codes can be applied to tickets sold online through event Storefronts, the Box Office and Sales Console, and on your site with a ticketing widget or WordPress plugin.

## Step 1: Add a discount code to your event.

**Open one of your events. Find &quot;Discounts&quot; under &quot;Share &amp; Sell.&quot;**

  ![Discount_Menu](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=124 &quot;Discounts live in the share and sell menu&quot;)

## Step 2: Create Discount Code Name

**This is what patrons will type in to receive the discount.** The code must be 4-15 characters long and may include numbers but not spaces. 

## Step 3: Choose the Show/s and Ticket Type/s

**Choose the shows for which the code can be used.** The default will allow patrons to use the code for any show in the event's run. Next, choose which of your ticket types are available for discount. You may include all ticket types or specify the discount for only a certain section or price.  

  ![Sample Discount](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=125 &quot;discount sample&quot;)

## Step 4: Choose Promotion Type

**You can create three types of promotions--set price deduction, buy one get one free, and group discount. **

*   **X dollars off each ticket&quot;** will subtract a set dollar amount off of each valid ticket in the patron's cart. Set the minimum purchase to 1.
*   **&quot;Buy one get one free&quot;** will charge the full value for one ticket and $0 for the second. Set the minimum purchase to 2\. This code will also work as a 'buy two get two free' and 'buy three get three free' etc. Please note that the $2 service fee still applies to all tickets in the order. For example, if a patron buys two $10 tickets and uses a two-for-one discount code, she will pay $10 + $2 for the first ticket and $0 + $2 for the second for a total of $14.
*   **Group discounts** can be created by raising the minimum purchase number. You may create either a set dollar amount off each ticket or a buy one get one free promotion and limit it to order of certain minimum number of tickets. For example, if your group discount only kicks in at 10 tickets and a patron tries to use it with a purchase of just 8 tickets, the discount will not work.

Note: Pricing can be done in dollar and cents, so be careful when inputting your discount price._

Step 5: Limit Total Tickets Sold with Discount

Choose how many tickets can be with sold with this code. The default is to offer unlimited discounted tickets to an event. You may want to change this setting and set a maximum number of discounted tickets if the discount is very large or you are concerned about selling out. Be aware that each ticket sold with a buy one get one free code count against this total amount. So if you limit the discount to 20 tickets, that will be 10 tickets paid at full price, and 10 tickets free.

  ![Discount_Inventory](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=126 &quot;discount_inventory&quot;)



## More Tips:

*   You can use the same code word for multiple events (eg. &quot;DanceFriend&quot;) but you'll need to set up the terms of the code in each event. This allows you to make &quot;DanceFriend&quot; worth $5 for tickets at one event and $15 at a different event.
*   Once you create a discount, a summary list of discounts will be created on the Discounts page. You may delete codes that have not been redeemed. Once a code has been used, you cannot delete it (this would mess up the sales accounting). To turn off a code, simply click on the code name in the summary discounts list, and uncheck the box labeled &quot;Discount is active and can be used now&quot;. You can see which codes are active and inactive on the summary discounts list.

  ![Discount Code List](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=127 &quot;discount code list&quot;)

*   You can explore how your patrons are using discounts in a **Show Statement** report or the **Discounts** report. Access these under **'Reports'** on the top menu bar.

		<field name="title">Intro to the Fractured Atlas Knowledge Base (CC)</field>
		<field name="content">### What is it?

The Fractured Atlas Knowledge Base is an online library of articles and videos that describe how to use our software tools and services. It is organized into two collections--the public Knowledge Base (KB) and the Internal Knowledge Base (IKB) which can only be seen by staff. 

The purpose of the public Knowledge Base is to teach our members how to navigate our tools and give them a place to answer their own questions 24-7. The purpose of the Internal Knowledge Base is focused on sharing tips for using internal tools, procedures for job-based tasks, and onboarding materials for new staff. Our hope is that the Knowledge Base will reduce customer service volume, increase customer satisfaction, streamline staff onboarding, and increase cross-department understanding.

### How is it organized?

The public KB and the IKB are organized with a similar hierarchy...

1. **Topics** = Programs or major areas. Only Adam and Shawn have permission to add new topics in either knowledge base.
 - **Public KB Topics**  
    - Artful.ly
    - Fiscal Sponsorship
    - Insurance
    - SpaceFinder
    - Membership
    - Visa Letters
    - Arts Entrepreneurship Awards
    - Other
- **IKB Topics**   
    - Who Is Fractured Atlas?
    - Members &amp; Database
    - Programs
    - Additional Services
    - External Communication
    - How We Work
    - Operations
    - Learning at Fractured Atlas  
2. **Categories** = Sections within a topic
  - [Browse all categories in this agent view](admin/Knowledgebase/category_list). 
  - Edit or delete categories from that list.
  - [All agents can add categories here.](/admin/Knowledgebase/category_form)  
3. **Articles** = Instructions or answers about a specific aspect of a program, service, or application
  - [Browse all articles in this agent view](/admin/Knowledgebase). You can filter by topic and category or search by keyword. 
  - Edit or delete articles from that list.
  - [All agents can add articles here.](/admin/Knowledgebase/article_form)  
  

### How do I use it?
  
All staff members have permission to write new articles or edit existing ones. Generally, you should talk to your supervisor before adding an article to the public Knowledge Base. Read these articles to learn how to create new articles...

		<field name="title">Can my Artful.ly ticket revenue go to my fiscally sponsored fund?</field>
		<field name="content">No, because donations and income from ticket sales are treated differently. Ticket sales are **earned** revenue, but your sponsored fund is for **contributed** revenue (donations). If you have an active fiscally sponsored project with Fractured Atlas, any donations you receive through Artful.ly are processed as contributed income per the terms of the sponsorship program. Income from ticketing is earned income which does not fall under the sponsorship program.

When you opt into the Paid Event Ticketing Kit, you need to submit your electronic funds transfer information so that we can send your ticketing revenue to your bank account. This can be the same bank account you use for fund releases from your sponsored fund. You can use your personal checking account to receive your ticketing revenue, but it's advisable to keep your company's revenues separate from your personal money. If you have a business bank account set up, you can send us an **[Artful.ly EFT form](https://www.artful.ly/forms/artfully_etf_sign_up.pdf)** and a copy of a voided check, and we'll set you up with the **Paid Event Ticketing Kit**.

### Looking for a deal on business checking accounts?

It doesn't matter where you set up your company bank account, but TD Bank does offer Fractured Atlas members a deal on new checking accounts: [https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/specialoffers/120](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/specialoffers/120).

		<field name="title">Why are my settlements off by a few cents?</field>
		<field name="content">When you look through your Artful.ly settlements, it might seem like there's a discrepancy of a few cents.

This is because the 3.5% credit card processing fee is deducted and rounded off from each ticket, donation, or membership as it is sold rather than a 3.5% charge applied to a whole settlement. For certain dollar amounts, these rounding differences will appear as a discrepancy of a few cents.

**For Example**:

**You have a show where the tickets cost $55.**

3.5% of a $55 ticket  = $1.925, but that gets rounded to $1.93.

$55 gross - $1.93 = $53.07 Net 

**Now say you've sold 5 tickets...**

If you multiply the whole settlement gross by the credit card percentage, you'll get...

$275 * 3.5%  = $9.625, rounded to $9.63

$275 - $9.63 = $265.37 Net

**The correct math is:**

($55 - $1.93) * 5 = $265.35 Net

		<field name="content">Artful.ly gives you a downloadable CSV template, this means &quot;Comma Separated Values,&quot; and is a file format that's universally accepted by most spreadsheet applications. This can be filled in with your fans' emails, addresses, event attendance, past donations, and more. Then, the template can be imported into Artful.ly, which will create People records for each of individuals or companies on your list. 

In order to format your file correctly for importing, you need to be able to view and edit the CSV file in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. If you have Excel on your computer, it will probably be the default program for reading CSV files.

## I don't have Excel...

If you don't have Excel software in your computer, don't worry. There are plenty of other tools you can use to format a CSV file for your import, such as:

*   [Google Drive](http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html#product=sheets) (free!)
*   [Open Office](http://www.openoffice.org)
*   [Numbers (for Macs)](http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers)
*   [A list of all sorts of spreadsheet software on Wikipedia (that also includes Microsoft Office for PC and Mac)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spreadsheet_software)

Pretty much any spreadsheet tool will let you read and edit a CSV file. And when you're done adding all your contacts, remember to save your spreadsheet as a CSV file type so Artful.ly can read it when you import it.

Each Seller shall review and respond to each purchase request promptly and shall not discriminate against potential Purchasers for any unlawful reason.

### 4\. Limitations on Use.

In accepting this License, you agree not to cause or permit the: (a) use, copying, or modification of the System, except as expressly provided in this Agreement; (b) reverse engineering, disassembly, decompilation, rental, lease, or transfer of the System; (c) use of the System for any unlawful purpose or in furtherance of any unlawful purpose; (d) use of the System to disseminate, store or transmit files, graphics, software or other material that is defamatory, libelous, obscene, unlawfully threatening or harassing, or that infringes the intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights of a third party; (e) transmission to the System of any virus, software program, segment of code or other programming design, instruction, or routine that permits unauthorized access to the System or our other services and that is intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any of the foregoing; or (f) use of or distribution through the System or our other services of any software or other tools or devices designed to interfere with or compromise the privacy, security or use of the operations or assets of us or any other user of the System or any other person or entity.

### 5\. Identity Verification.

User verification on the Internet is difficult and we cannot confirm, and do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of, each user's purported identity. We encourage you to communicate directly with a Seller or Purchaser, or Donor and Donee, through the tools available on the System. You agree to (i) keep your password and online ID secure and strictly confidential, providing it only to authorized users of your account, (ii) instruct each person to whom you give your online ID and password that he or she is not to disclose it to any unauthorized person, (iii) notify us immediately and select a new online ID and password if you believe your password may have become known to an unauthorized person, and (iv) notify us immediately if you are contacted by anyone requesting your online ID and password. We discourage you from giving anyone access to your online ID and password. However, if you do give someone your online ID and online password, or if you fail to adequately safeguard such information, you are responsible for any and all transactions that the person performs while using your account, even those transactions that are fraudulent or that you did not intend or want performed. EACH USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT: (1) NEITHER WE NOR OUR AFFILIATES WILL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY USER FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION MADE USING ANY USER'S PASSWORD THAT OCCURS BEFORE SUCH USER HAS NOTIFIED US OF POSSIBLE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF SUCH PASSWORD AND WE HAVE HAD A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO ACT ON THAT NOTICE; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR ONLINE ID AND PASSWORD COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO BOTH US AND OTHER USERS. Further, we may, without notice to you, suspend or cancel your listing at any time even without receiving notice from you if we suspect, in our sole discretion, that your password is being used in an unauthorized or fraudulent manner.

### 6\. Limitations on Communications and Use of Other Users’ Information.

You agree that, with respect to other users' personal information that you obtain through the System or through any related communication or transaction, we have granted to you a license to use such information only for: (a) communications that are related to the transaction and are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) using services offered through the website or the System, (c) facilitating a financial transaction between you and the other user (such as an on-line purchase or donation or charging a personal credit card) and (d) any other purpose that a user expressly agrees to after you tell them the purpose you would like to use it for. In all cases, you must give users an opportunity to remove themselves from your address book or database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this provision, may you disclose personal information about another user to any third party without both our consent and the consent of the other user. You agree that other users may use your information to communicate with you in accordance with this provision. Further, you agree that you will protect other users' personal information with the same degree of care that you protect your own confidential information (using at minimum a reasonable standard of care), and you assume all liability for the misuse, loss, or unauthorized transfer of such information.

### 7\. Responsibility for User-Contributed Content.

We have no duty to pre-screen content posted on the System by Seller, Purchaser, Donors, Donees or other users (collectively, “user-contributed content”) and we are not responsible for user-contributed content. We do, however, reserve the right to decline to permit the posting on the System of, or to remove from the website, any user-contributed content that violates the terms of this Agreement or that otherwise violate our general Terms of Use. We reserve the right (but do not assume the obligation) to edit Seller or Donee content in a non-substantive manner solely to cause the content to comply with our content guidelines or formatting requirements.

### 8\. Limitation on Liability.

All information relating to the sale of tickets to performance events on the System are submitted by the Seller and are the sole responsibility of the Seller, and we specifically disclaim any and all liability arising from the alleged accuracy of the listings or any alleged breaches of contract on a Seller’s part. All information relating to the acceptance or solicitation of donations on the System are submitted by the Donee and are the sole responsibility of the Donee, and we specifically disclaim any and all liability arising from the alleged accuracy of the listings or any alleged breaches of contract on a Donee’s part. Sellers and Donees are solely responsible for keeping their posted information up-to-date on the System. We do not represent or warrant that any of the copy, content, pricing or availability information published on the System is accurate or up-to-date even in the case where prospective Purchasers or Donors have searched for specific special offers or dates. IN NO EVENT WILL WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND/OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, BASED ON, OR RESULTING FROM (A) THE SYSTEM OR OUR WEBSITE, (B) THIS AGREEMENT, (C) ANY BREACH OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR OF OUR GENERAL TERMS OF USE BY YOU OR A THIRD PARTY, (D) USE OF THE SYSTEM, TOOLS OR SERVICES WE PROVIDE RELATED TO THE BUSINESS WE OPERATE ON THE WEBSITE BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY AND/OR (E) ANY ACTUAL OR ATTEMPTED COMMUNICATION OR TRANSACTION BETWEEN USERS, IN EACH CASE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE SYSTEM, YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THE TERMS, OR HAVE ANY OTHER DISPUTE OR CLAIM WITH OR AGAINST US OR ANOTHER USER OF THE SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO THE TERMS OR THE WEBSITE, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST US IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SYSTEM. IN ALL EVENTS, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SYSTEM IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT OF FEES YOU PAY TO US IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY OR (B) $100.00 IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ALL CLAIMS.

### Suspected Violation of these TOU or Law; Injunctive, Equitable Relief, and Liquidated Damages

Violations of these TOU, including unauthorized use of the web site, may be investigated and appropriate legal action may be taken, including without limitation civil, criminal and injunctive redress. You understand and agree that in our sole discretion, and without prior notice, we may terminate and block your access to artful.ly, cancel your ticket or merchandise order and tickets or merchandise acquired through your order, refuse to honor pending and future purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts we believe may be associated with you, cancel a ticket or ticket order associated with any person acting or believed to be acting in concert with you, cancel your ticket postings, or exercise any other remedy available, if we believe that your conduct or the conduct of any person with whom we believe you act in concert, or any resale of such tickets purchased through artful.ly, violates or is inconsistent with these TOU or the law, or violates our rights, the rights of a client of ours or those of another user of the web site. Violating any limitations or terms on artful.ly, including but not limited to utilizing automated means to process or place ticket orders or ordering a number of tickets that exceeds the stated limit, will be deemed to be a violation of these TOU. If we are unable to verify or authenticate any information or tickets you provide during any registration, ordering, purchase, ticket posting, sale, authentication, delivery, payment or remittance process, or any other process, or if we are no longer able to verify or authorize your credit card or bank account information, your tickets may be cancelled, we may refuse to honor all pending and future ticket purchases made on such credit card accounts and on any online accounts associated with such credit card accounts, and you may be prohibited from using the web site.   You agree that monetary damages may not provide us a sufficient remedy for violations of these TOU and you consent to injunctive or other equitable relief for such violations.   You agree that abusive use of the web site, as defined above, causes damage and harm to us in the form of, among other things, impaired goodwill, lost sales, and increased expenses associated with responding to abusive use of the web site. You further agree that monetary damages for abusive use of the web site are difficult to ascertain and that proof of monetary damages for abusive use would be costly and difficult to calculate. Accordingly you agree that liquidated damages are warranted for abusive use. Therefore, you agree that if you, or others acting in concert with you, alone or collectively request more than 100 pages of the Site in any twenty-four hour period, you, and those acting in concert with you, will be jointly and severally liable for liquidated damages in the amount of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page request each time that a page request is made after that first 100 during that twenty-four hour period. You also agree that this will be the measure of damages for any abusive use that occurred prior to this provision of these TOU being in effect.   We are not required to provide any refund to you if you have violated these TOU or any of our rights. Additionally, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, suspend or discontinue any part of this web site at any time, with or without notice to you. We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to impose limits on certain features and services and to restrict access to any part or to the entire web site without notice to you.

### Information Collection

We collect information from users of this web site at several different points on this web site. When you opt to use many of the services on our web site, you must first set up an account, which requires you to submit contact information (i.e., email and mailing address), demographic information, and certain unique identifiers. We only ask for such information as is necessary for the provision of member services, and we use it in the provision of those services.

In the event you make a transaction through the web site, we may collect your credit card number or other payment account number, billing address and other information related to such purchase (collectively, &quot;Payment Information&quot;) from you. The Payment Information is transmitted via secure, encrypted processes. We do not store credit card numbers any longer than is necessary to process transactions and provide related support. Our third-party credit card processing vendors may store credit card numbers indefinitely, and are responsible for ensuring the security of such storage.

We will use the Payment Information that you provide to bill you for and fulfill your transaction. By providing your Payment Information, you are authorizing us to give that information to third parties as necessary to confirm and fulfill your order (for example, to process your credit card or payment account number and to send you products you have ordered).

### Traffic Analysis

This web site uses &quot;cookies&quot; exclusively to aid the login process. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. The cookies used by this web site contain very minimal information used only to identify and authenticate members. No sensitive identifying information is stored by cookies.

Like most standard web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. These types of files are not linked to sensitive identifying information.

### Third Party Information Use

We do not share individual demographic information with any advertisers or other outside companies.

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose demographic or other identifying information collected on our web site when required by law when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site.

In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of our assets, users’ information will be, in most instances, part of the assets transferred.

		<field name="id">204</field>
		<field name="title">Order Details</field>
		<field name="content">Every order made through any sales channel will create Order Details. This is where you'll go: 

- Make and read notes on orders 
- Perform returns, refunds, and exchanges
- Audit the history of an order
- Resend email receipts and print hard copies

Here's an example of what the order details page can look like: 

![A very complex order details page featuring different inventory types, exchanges, and internal notes](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=835 &quot;complex order details&quot;)

## Notes on Orders
Order Details pages have two places where you can read notes on an order: **Special Instructions** and **Internal Notes**. If you ask a question at checkout using Special Instructions, they'll appear in yellow. You can add your own notes to an order during a transaction in the Box Office or Sales Console, or on the Order Details page. Your Internal Notes appear in blue. 

More information on adding Internal Notes and Special instructions can be found in this article: [Internal Notes &amp; Special Instructions on Orders](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/internal-notes-special-instructions-on-orders)

## Refunds, Returns, &amp; Exchanges
You'll also open Order Details if you need to refund, return, and exchange tickets, donations, memberships, or passes. Each of these inventory types gets their own table on the page. 

You can take action on multiple items in a table by ticking the checkboxes next to what you want to refund, return, or exchange, and use the gear button above the table. To refund, return, or exchange one item in a table, click the gear icon on that inventory item's line.

![Refund, Return, or Exchange Multiple Tickets](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=840 &quot;refund, return, or exchange multiple tickets&quot;)

Once something has been returned, refunded, or exchanged, it will create a separate order we call a child order. The original (or parent) order will list everything in the original order, and the child order will list the changes. This information, along with the links to the child orders can be found in the grey box on the right hand side of the order details page.

For a more detailed look at how to perform refunds, check out [Refunds, Exchanges, and Returns](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/refunds-exchanges-returns).

Additionally, the user account of the staff member who created the order will appear in the **Created By** line. For this reason, it's good to have user accounts for each of your staff members. You can find out more on adding administrators to your account in this article: [Adding Users &amp; Managing User Permissions](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/adding-users-managing-user-permissions-).

## Resending &amp; Printing Receipts
If one of your supporters lost her receipt and needs a new copy emailed to her, you can quickly do that from the **Work With** button on the upper right hand corner of the page. 

There's also the option to print a receipt, and if your organization is using the [Print at Home Scannable Tickets Kit](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/print-at-home-scannable-tickets-kit) you can print a customer's barcoded tickets.

		<field name="content">Your Storefront is open to sell tickets up to one hour after your show begins. After about an hour, the storefront stops displaying the show so that patrons can't buy tickets from home too long after the curtain rises. 

If you'd like to remove the show from your storefront sooner, you can unpublish the show or take tickets off sale at any time. These actions can be done on the **Show Details** page. This puts you in control of exactly when or where the patron will see it.

  ![taking tickets off sale in show details](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=137 &quot;take tickets off sale&quot;)

On the other hand, producers can sell tickets via the box office up to two business days after each show. Credit card sales should not be made after this time period because the show settlement will have already been sent and thus it will be impossible to settle the funds.

## Artful.ly receipts include the following information:

*   Receipts are referred to as **&quot;Order Confirmations&quot;**
*   They remind patrons that the charge on their credit card statement will appear as **&quot;Artful.ly&quot;**
*   **Order number:** This is corresponds to the **Order ID** number you see in Transaction records
*   **Purchase date**
*   **Order total:** The total value of tickets and/or donations
*   **Payment method**: This will either be credit card, cash, or comp. The credit card type and number is not provided
*   **Service fee:** The total fee for the entire order.[Here's a reminder about Artful.ly Fees and when they appear to the Patron](/site/knowledgebase/what-s-it-cost-)
*   **Venue location**
*   **Contact email and phone number** (If you provided one)
*   **Itemized list** featuring:
  - Each ticket type purchased 
  - Ticket Type description
  - Receipt details—great for things like telling people where to park and other details that don't need to be included in the ticket type description. 
  - Price
  - Donation amount (if applicable)

## Where do receipts come from? 

They are automatically emailed to the patron from support@artful.ly immediately following the transaction.

**For Charity Donations:** The receipt is only to document the transaction. You will need to send any additional tax-related documentation (such as information about partially deductible donations) separately.

**For Donations to **Fractured Atlas** Fiscally Sponsored Projects: **Receipts will be emailed separately from Fractured Atlas (support@fracturedatlas.org) and will serve as the patron's receipt for tax purposes**.** If the donation is made in addition to a ticket purchase, the patron will receive two separate receipts simultaneously.[Here's more information about Fiscal Sponsorship Donations.](/site/knowledgebase/donations-to-fiscally-sponsored-projects)

## Who do patrons contact if they need a new receipt or have questions about their order?

		<field name="title">Sales Console: A Private Sales Channel for Complex Orders</field>
		<field name="content">## Sales Console v. Box Office

The Sales Console is a private sales channel for producers to manage more complex orders outside of the Box Office. From the Sales Console you can sell tickets to multiple events, sell passes or memberships (if those kits are activated), apply discount codes, and even take donations. It's also an avenue to process ticket sales for passholders and members. Keep in mind that credit card swipers are currently only supported in the Box Office. 

Depending on the situation, choose the appropriate sales interface:

*   Sales Console for complex orders with multiple items
*   Box Office for simple ticket sales for just one show when speed is the priority

Sales made through the Sales Console will...

*   Send the customer a receipt
*   Create a record for a new customer, or add the information to an existing record
*   Log the appropriate Bought or Gave Actions on the customer's record

## Using The Sales Console

The Sales Console can be found under the **Sell** menu

![Navigate to Sales Console](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=138 &quot;Navigate to Sales Console&quot;)

## Sales Console Tiles

![Sales Console Tiles](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=142 &quot;Sales Console Tiles&quot;)

The look of your sales console will vary depending on your organization and which kits are enabled. You may see the following tiles:

*   **Tickets**: Regular and member tickets are added through this tile.
*   **Donations**: Organizations with the 501(c)(3) Donations Kit enabled can process donations outside of the storefront or widget.
*   **Memberships**: Allows organizations with the Memberships Kit to sell memberships directly to patrons.
*   **Passes**: Allows organizations with the Passes Kit to sell passes directly to patrons.
*   **Apply Pass Or Discount Code**: This tile is used to apply a patron's passcode, as well as any discount codes you've created for events.

Click on these tiles and select various options to build an order. You'll see a list of all the items in the order on the right under **Order Summary.**

## Selling Through The Sales Console

1.  Click on the tickets tile and select the event you want to sell tickets to. **Note**: in order to sell tickets through the sales console, the tickets must also be available in the Storefront and Widget.
2.  Select the show.
3.  Add tickets to the cart.  

 ![Add Tickets](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=146 &quot;Add Tickets&quot;)  

4.  If your patron wants to add a donation, you can use the donation tile to add a donation to an order, or you can also apply a Discount or Pass code to the order.  

 ![Donation or Discount](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=147 &quot;Donation or Discount&quot;) 

5.  When the order is built, click the green Check Out tile. The interface for checking out an order will feel similar to the Box Office. You can sell items through the Sales Console via cash, credit, or check—or you can comp an order. Comp sales willl not generate an email receipt to the patron unless you check the box to send a confirmation email; the checkbox is above the checkout button.  

 ![Add Payment Information](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=141 &quot;Add Payment Information&quot;) 

## Sell to an Existing Customer

If the customer you're selling to is already in your Artful.ly records, you can help keep your database tidy by using the **Sell To** feature.

1.  Navigate to the patron's record.
2.  Click the **Work With** button and select **Sell to**.  

 ![Sell To Existing Customer](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=143 &quot;Sell To Existing Customer&quot;)

3.  Build the order in the Sales Console.
4.  When you go to check out, the customer's contact information will already be filled into the buyer info fields.  

 ![Check Out](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=144 &quot;Check Out&quot;)

## Sales Console Fees

*   Tickets purchased via credit card are not charged the $2 service fee, but the 3.5% credit card fee still applies.
*   There are no charges for logging sales via check, cash, or comp.

## Defining &quot;Membership&quot;

Membership, Subscription, Season Supporter, Friend of the Theater—memberships can mean something completely different depending on the organization. For Artful.ly, we've designed two membership paradigms to cover a variety of business strategies. 

Artful.ly membership features allow you to:

*   Create and sell multiple membership types (or levels) with different names, price points, and benefits
*   Sell member-only ticket types with special member pricing
*   Make events or shows only visible to logged in members
*   Sell tickets to members before they go on sale to the general public
*   Offer special membership renewal pricing

## Two Flavors of Membership

To accommodate a wide range of business rules, we've structured memberships into two flexible types:

**Season**: Members sign up and receive benefits for your theatrical season, a calendar year, or some other term with a fixed end date. Sign-ups and renewals are focused at a certain time of year.

**Rolling**: Members sign up and receive benefits for a number of months or years from their sign-up date. Members can start at any time and renewal takes place whenever an individual's membership expires.

## Tickets to Multiple Shows

Memberships might not be the right solution for every organization. Patrons can also buy tickets to multiple shows  though **Passes**. To learn more about the differences, take a look at our article [Memberships v Passes](https://artfully.zendesk.com/entries/79532407-Beta-Membership-v-Passes).

## Tax Deductibility for 501(c)(3) Organizations

Organizations that have their own 501(c)(3) status can issue tax receipts for memberships based on their own business rules.

## Tax Deductibility for Fractured Atlas Fiscally Sponsored Projects

Fractured Atlas fiscally sponsored projects may sell memberships, but the purchase is not tax deductible for your fans. The funds from membership sales are deposited directly into your organization's bank account, rather than your sponsored fund. Membership revenue does not count for your grant-eligibility requirement.

Patrons do have the option to add a tax-deductible donation on top of a membership purchase, and sponsored projects may also use the Donation Widget or Wordpress Plugin.

However, we plan to build features to do this soon. If you would like these features for your organization, please vote for it in our Feature Request forum: [Allow fiscally sponsored projects to sell tax-deductible tickets, memberships, and passes](https://artfully.zendesk.com/entries/21620351-Allow-fiscally-sponsored-projects-to-sell-tax-deductible-tickets-memberships-and-passes).

		<field name="content">There are a lot of ways to take tickets off sale in Artful.ly which range from changing who can see a ticket type, modifying your show's capacity and ticket inventory, or unpublishing the show entirely. We'll detail all of the options here.

## Adjusting Visibility For Individual Ticket Types- Taking Tickets On or Off Sale in the Storefront

Taking the tickets out of the storefront will make those ticket types no longer visible. This can be useful if you want a ticket type available at the door, but not for advance sales.

*   **The edit menu **allows for changes to the ticket name, price, and description. You can also choose where tickets are visible for purchase.

*   If, for instance, you do NOT want a ticket type available to patrons online, and only want to sell tickets at the box office, **uncheck Storefront and Widgets**. This is also useful if you want to end ticket sales early for a particular ticket type.
*   **You can also limit the number of tickets available for that type**. If there is no limit besides the capacity of the venue, leave the box blank.

  ![Editing an individual ticket type using the work with button](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=162 &quot;edit a ticket type&quot;)
 
  ![editing ticket type visibility modal](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=163 &quot;ticket type modal&quot;)

## Option 2: Adjusting the Ticket Capacity of a Show

*   The capacity reflects overall availability in your venue for all ticket types.
*   Ticket types reflect different price points for certain patrons or limited availability of special tickets (like rush tickets).

For example, you have 100 seats in your venue and they are available to any mix of students, seniors, or the general public. You can set your capacity at 100\. Those 100 seats can be filled by any combination of students, seniors, and the general public, so you would set all those ticket types to UNLIMITED. You also offer a special rush deal for the first 10 people who say 'pumpernickel' at the door, so you would limit that ticket type to 10.

## Unpublish a Show or Take Tickets on and Off Sale: List View

If you need to take tickets on or off sale, it's easy adjust your ticket capacity from the list view.

*   Go to **Shows** and select **List.**
*   Click on the **Gear **to perform an action on a show.
*   Select **Put on Sale **or **Take off Sale** to adjust your show's capacity. Taking tickets off sale removes them from the available ticket pool. This can be useful if you want to hold back some tickets for door sales. Just remember to put them back on sale when you're ready to begin those sales.

   ![Using the work with button on list view can take a batch of tickets on or off sale](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=164 &quot;list view take tickets on or off sale&quot;)

		<field name="title">Refunds, Exchanges &amp; Returns</field>
		<field name="content">## What's the difference between a Refund, Exchange, and Return?

**Refund**: Refunds full price of ticket to the patron. This applies to paid and free tickets.

**Exchange**: Swaps original ticket for another. Use this when the tickets have equal value.

**Return**: Returns a ticket to inventory. This is for Comp tickets.

## When can I issue Refunds or Exchanges?
**Cash/Check:** Exchanges and refunds can be made immediately following the purchase and up to two days after the show.

**Credit Card:** Exchanges can be made immediately after the purchase. Refunds cannot be made until at least one business day after the purchase was made. Exchanges may be made up until showtime, and refunds can be made until two days after the show. 

Donations are held for two days before they are issued for settlement, and they can be refunded before the settlement is issued. If a refund needs to happen after the two day period has passed, the producer is responsible for issuing the refund to the patron.

## Refunding a Ticket, Membership, Pass, or Donation:
1.  Select **Orders** and then the appropriate inventory item from the top menu bar.
2.  If the purchase wasn't made recently, use the date selectors to narrow the date range.
3.  When you've located the purchase you are looking for, click on the **Order ID** number to go to the Order Details.
4.  On the Order Details, you can refund a single ticket by clicking the gear icon next to each item, or use the checkbox above the table to refund all of the tickets in an order. Tickets, donations, memberships, and passes must be refunded separately. 
5.  Select **Refund**, and you will be prompted to either issue a refund and return the ticket to the show's inventory (back on sale), or issue the refund and keep the ticket out of the pool of available tickets.
6.  Credit Card refunds will show up on the patron's card statement within 3-5 business days.

  ![The orders for ticket sales page](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=169 &quot;orders ticket sales&quot;)

## Exchanging Tickets of Equal Value:

1.  Go through steps 1-4 above.
2.  Select **Exchange,** and you will be prompted to select an event to which you'd like to exchange the ticket for, a show date, and ticket types.
3.  A list of individual tickets will pop up based on the number of tickets that are available at that ticket type for the show. Select one, than select the **Exchange** ticket button at the bottom of the page. 
  ![exchanging tickets view](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=830 &quot;exchange tickets&quot;)

## Exchanging a Ticket for Another at a Different Price
Partial payments or refunds aren't currently possible in Artful.ly. If patron wants to exchange tickets for new ones at a different price point, you must:

1.  Refund the original ticket(s).
2.  Have the patron purchase the new ticket(s).

## Returning a Ticket (for comp tickets only):

1.  Comped tickets can be returned. This puts the free ticket back on sale. 
2.  Repeat steps 1-4 under Refunds above.
3.  Instead of an option to refund you'll see a button labeled return. Select that and the ticket will be put back in your pool of available tickets.

		<field name="content">**All complementary tickets are issued through the Box Office or Sales Console.** Basically, &quot;comp&quot; is a payment type you can use to give any ticket to a specific individual. For each show you need to comp tickets to, either:

1. Go to that show's detail page. Select **Shows **in the side menu, then select the date and time from your show list.

2. Select **Box Office** and [execute a box office sale](/site/knowledgebase/box-office-sell-tickets-at-the-door) using &quot;Comp&quot; as the payment method.

OR

1. Build an order in the [Sales Console](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/sales-console-a-private-sales-channel-for-complex-orders) and use &quot;comp&quot; as the payment method.

Comp sales will not automatically send confirmation emails. If you'd like to send a confirmation email with the comp, be sure to check the box for it right before the checkout button. 

![Checkbox to send confirmation for comp order](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=806)

In general it's a good idea to send email confirmations with comp orders. If you have a situation where that would be weird, though, you can leave it blank. It's especially a good idea to send confirmation emails if your organization has the scannable tickets kit turned on.

If you didn't send a confirmation email with the comp order you can [resend the receipt](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/resending-receipts).

		<field name="content">**There are a number of ways to organize group sales depending on the organization of your event.** Patrons are currently limited to 10 tickets at once through the storefront or 20 tickets in a single order through the box office. With that in mind, here are some ways to organize group sales for your event.

## Using Discount Codes for Groups

**Group discounts are easy to offer by creating a discount code and raising the minimum purchase number.** For example: if your group discount kicks in at 10 tickets and a patron tries to use it with a purchase of 8 tickets, the discount will not work. You can also create tiered discounts by offering multiple codes that work at different ticket amounts, for instance $2 off each ticket for groups of 5 or more, or $3 off each ticket for a group of 10.

**You can also use discount codes for a specific group larger than 10** by giving the discount code to the organization and having individuals purchase their tickets using the code. To prevent unwarranted sharing of the code, you may limit the number of times the code may be used.

  ![group discount codes](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=171 &quot;group discount codes&quot;)

##Using the Sales Console or Box Office Over the Phone

**Unless you are openly advertising group rates, many will be negotiated over the phone or email.** To sell a group rate over the phone, create a special ticket type for the requested show with the appropriate price and limit the number to match the amount of tickets you'll need to sell. Then, using either the sales console the box office, you can sell these tickets using the patrons credit card number up to 20 tickets at a time. Groups larger than 20 will require multiple transactions.

Please Note: When creating the ticket type for the show, make sure the ticket is available in the box office but not the Storefront. [Read more about hiding a ticket type from the Storefront here](/site/knowledgebase/how-do-i-take-tickets-off-sale).

  ![box office group sale](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=172 &quot;box office group sale&quot;)

## Buy-Out Events and Performances for Large Groups

If a patron wants an exclusive event or performance for a very large group (birthday parties, corporate outings, etc.), **i**t may be simplest to create a special event or show for them with its own ticket type. Create a ticket type with one (presumably fairly expensive) ticket. If you would still like to collective RSVP information for the attendees, create a free ticket type in conjunction and share the storefront URL with that group exclusively.

		<field name="content">## How do I Import Events?
**Artful.ly makes importing your ticketing and event history easy.** Import old attendance records or sales from other ticketing portals by following these steps:

  1. Go to **Reports**

  2. Select** Imports/Exports**
  
  ![select reports and imports and exports](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=173 &quot;imports and exports&quot;)

  3. Click **Import Events**
  4. Under the heading &quot;Template&quot; download an empty CSV file with appropriate headers for your specific data (see below). **Important: Your files must be in CSV (comma separated-values) format in order to upload.** [Learn how to save an Excel file as a CSV here.](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-HP010099725.aspx)
  5. Copy/paste the data from your old spreadsheet into the appropriate columns. Make sure to include all required fields as described under &quot;Format&quot;.  
  ![Import Events](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=174 &quot;Import Events&quot;)
  6.  **Event and Venue Name are mandatory fields.** If you don't have that data filled in, the import won't work. For every patron or attendee, you must include either a first name, a last name, or an email address.   
  7. When your CSV is ready, select **Choose File **under the header &quot;Upload&quot; and retrieve the file from your computer. Once you see the file name appear, you can select **Import**. It may take a few minutes for your contacts to be imported.
  8. Once it has been processed (and there are no errors) you must **approve** the import. Depending on the size of the file, it may take a few minutes.  
  ![approve import](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=175 &quot;approve import&quot;)

## Importing Tips
*   **Make sure your column headers match those in the blank CSV.** If your CSV is not organized properly or the information is in the wrong place (email in the wrong column, for instance), you will receive an error message. We recommend you delete the file and adjust the spreadsheet appropriately before uploading it again.
*   **Observe usable values and date formatting. **Make sure you use the right terms (for example: CASH or CREDIT CARD in Payment Methods) when filling out your spreadsheet. Also, observe the specific formatting for dates so your data isn't confused.  You can make this a default setting in Excel (right click on the column &gt; Format Cells &gt; Date).
*   **Tidy up your data in the CSV before you import it.** It's much easier to fix typos and formatting in a spreadsheet rather than doing it record-by-record in the app.
*   Make sure you import your event in one CSV. This ensures the cleanest import of the event. 

**If you have a yearly event, it's best to label each event with the year it occurred.** If several years' attendance of a yearly event is imported at once then each year will be imported as a show. It will be much cleaner for your accounting if you label these events as &quot;Annual Gala 2014,&quot; &quot;Annual Gala 2013,&quot; and so on.  
   
## Can I delete an import? 
Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to delete a whole event import. Please exercise a great deal of caution before importing an event and make sure you double check your work.

What donations did she give? What communication did she hear? etc. If you see all of these interactions in one place, then you can start to see correlations between the Tuesday eblast and the Wednesday ticket sales.

##Action Types:
*   **Bought Actions** record ticket purchases. They are automatically created when a patron buys tickets through any Artful.ly [sales channel](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/sales-channels-explained). Bought actions are also created when you [import an event](/site/knowledgebase/importing-events). Bought actions cannot manually be added.
*   **Gave Actions** record donations. Gave actions are automatically logged if the donation is made through Artful.ly, or you've linked your account to your fiscally sponsored project. 501(c)(3) organizations may manually log donations you receive via cash or check and donations received through other credit card processors. Fiscally sponsored projects should log their donations through their My Fiscal Sponsorship Page.
*   **Heard Actions** record emails, eblasts, phone calls, and other communications your organization sent to a patron. Heard actions are what that person heard from you and your team. If you have activated the [MailChimp kit](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/what-is-mailchimp-and-why-should-i-use-it), Heard actions will be logged for all people who receive your MailChimp campaigns. You can also manually add Heard actions.
*   **Helped Actions** record volunteer activity; all are manually logged.
*   **Said Actions** record communications from a patron such as emails and phone calls. Said actions are the opposite of heard actions; it's what the fan told you. These are manually logged.
*   **Went Actions** record events a fan attended. Use these for events you didn't ticket or where a ticket purchase might vary from actual attendance. Went actions are automatically logged if you check off people from a show's door list. Otherwise, you can manually log Went actions post-event.

 ![action feed detail view](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=176 &quot;action feed&quot;)

## Manually Adding an Action
1. From a people record, select the **Add** button next to &quot;Action Feed&quot;  
    ![adding an action on a people record](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=771 &quot;add action&quot;)
2.  Select the relevant **Action Type** from the buttons
3.  Adjust the **Date**
4.  Complete additional fields accordingly to record action details
5.  For Said and Heard action types, select a communication method subtype
6.  **Save** your action.

After you log an action, you can also see who created it by clicking on the action and selecting &quot;Edit&quot;. The creator will be listed in the edit box.

##Bulk Adding Actions
You can add the same action to multiple people's records at the same time via Advanced Search:

1.  From the top menu, select **People**, then **Advanced Search**
2.  Set search criteria.
3.  Click **Search**.
4.  To the right of the search returns, click the **Work with...** button, then select **Log action**.
5.  Proceed as you would manually entering an action for one person.

OR, bulk add actions via List Segments:

1.  From the top menu, select **People**, then **List Segments**.
2.  Choose a list segment.
3.  To the left of the names in your segment, click the** Work with...** button, then select **Log action**.
4.  Proceed as you would manually entering an action for one person.

 ![work with button on list segment](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=178 &quot;work with button on list segment&quot;)

## Starring Actions
The Action Feed is automatically sorted from most recent actions down to the oldest. The list of actions could get pretty long and a push an important action down below where you and your team might ordinarily look. For important actions, click the gray star to the left of the action date. This will turn the star yellow. Refresh your browser and you'll see all the starred action filter to the top of the Action Feed. 

 ![starring actions](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=179 &quot;starring actions&quot;)

By the way, you can also star important notes. Only the first three starred notes will show up on the front of a patron's record, but the rest will appear when you click the &quot;X more notes&quot; link.

**Note**: It's currently not possible to purchase a membership and use it to buy member tickets in the same order. The same applies to selling passes and applying the pass code in the same order. These must be done over two transactions: one to sell the pass or membership, and the next one to buy tickets. If this is important to your organization, please let us know in the [feature request forum](https://artfully.zendesk.com/forums/318163-Feature-Requests).

## Sales Console Fees Structure for Memberships

*   **Memberships and passes** sold via credit card are charged the 5% service fee plus the 3.5% credit card processing fee. The 5% service fee will be added to the order total if you designated that when setting up the membership or pass type.   

* BETA USERS: We are not charging the 5% service charge for sales via Sale Console during the beta period.  

## Selling Memberships Through the Sales Console

1. Navigate to the Sales Console through the **Sell** menu or select **Sell To** on a people record.
2. Select the **Memberships** tile and then select the membership type.  

 ![Sales Console Memberships](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=186 &quot;Sales Console Memberships&quot;) 
3. Select the green **Check Out** tile. After you sell the membership you can then use the **Sell to** function in the **Work With** button on the patron's record to sell member tickets to the patron.

## Selling Member Tickets Through the Sales Console

  1.  Search for an individual's **People Record**.

  2.  Click **Work With** and select **Sell To**.  

 ![Grace Lawson Sell To](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=187 &quot;Grace Lawson Sell To&quot;) 

  3.  Build the order for the patron and select the member tickets. Since you're selling to a member, the tickets will be available. Note that the tickets must also be available in the Storefront and Widgets in order to be sold through the Sales Console.  

 ![Sales Console](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=190 &quot;Sales Console&quot;)  

  4.  Add any other items to the order and click the green **Check Ou**t tile and select the proper payment method.
  5.  Since you're using the Sell To function, the patron's contact information will automatically be filled into the buyer info fields.This helps to keep your database clean and organized.

    ![Sell Memberships](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=198 &quot;Sell Memberships&quot;)
2.  There are two types of memberships available: **Season** and **Rolling.**  

     ![Membership Type](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=200 &quot;Membership Type&quot;)

*   If your programming is only for part of the year or has a fixed beginning and end date, it's probably best to choose a **Seasonal** membership.
*   If your programming is year-round, it's probably better to choose a **Rolling** membership.

## Basic Membership Details

Setting up a Membership is similar to setting up a ticket type, so if you've ticketed a show with Artful.ly, the workflow should feel familiar.

1.  **Membership Name:** This could just be &quot;Membership,&quot; or it could be a creative name specific to your organization. If you sell multiple types of membership you'll want to make sure each type has a different name. For example, if you have &quot;Bronze,&quot; &quot;Silver,&quot; or &quot;Gold&quot; memberships, you would have three membership types each with a different name.  

2.  **Description:** Describe the benefits a patron gets by purchasing this membership. Similar to a ticket type description, this is where you communicate the nitty-gritty details.  

    ![Edit Description](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=201 &quot;Edit Description&quot;) 

3.  **Membership Start and End Date (Seasonal Only):** This is where you define a season for a seasonal membership by choosing a start date and an end date. This is the range of time the membership will be valid for.  
      ![Membership Dates](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=202 &quot;Membership Dates&quot;)

4.  **(Or) Membership Duration (Rolling Only):** If you're setting up a rolling membership, you'll define the length of the membership, as opposed to the date range of the season. Most organizations will probably choose one year.  

    ![Duration Dropdown](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=199 &quot;Duration Dropdown&quot;)

## Pricing

1.  **Set the membership price**: Enter the cost of the membership.
2.  **Add renewal price**: If you select to offer a renewal price, the patron will have the option to re-up at a discounted rate when their membership expires.
3.  **Choose who pays the fee**: You have the option to have the patron pay the service fee, or fold the cost into the membership price. For a detailed breakdown, check out our [membership fees article.](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/beta-membership-fees-settlements)  

    ![Membership Pricing](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=204 &quot;Membership Pricing&quot;)

## Storefront Copy

*   **Thanks Message:** The thanks message appears on your patron's browser after he or she has purchased a membership. 
*   **Email Message:** After purchasing a membership, your patron is sent an email confirmation message with further instructions. You can customize this to include details about how to use their membership benefits or thank them once again.

  ![Storefront Copy](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=203 &quot;Storefront Copy&quot;)

## Sales

1.  **Sales Start:** Select the date when people can first buy a membership. This is useful if you're creating your membership type before it goes on sale.
2.  **Sales End: ** This is the last day a patron could buy a membership. An end date is especially important for organizations that sell memberships for a season that runs for part of the year.
3.  **Show on Storefront:** Checking this box publishes the membership type to your membership storefront. In most cases, you'll want to have this box checked, but if you have a private membership type, you can leave the box unchecked. This is similar to publishing and unpublishing a show.
4.  **Limit Per Transaction:** This limit is how many memberships a patron can buy in one transaction. In most cases, you'll want to leave this option at one. Here are two sample scenarios for setting a limit: 

 *   When a membership equals one seat per play, an organization may want to allow a single patron to purchase multiple memberships for him and his family members.
 *   If your organization does not limit how many tickets a member can buy at a discount, you'll want to leave the limit per transaction at one: One Patron - One Membership.  

    ![Sales Definition](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=205 &quot;Sales Definition&quot;)

Once your membership type is saved it will be available in your Organization's **Membership Storefront. **You can reach the membership storefront from the link on the membership type creation page, or by going to your Central Storefront and clicking **Become a Member.**

		<field name="title">Taking a Down-Payment for a Longer Rental</field>
		<field name="content">Renters sometimes need an entire space for larger blocks of time, sometimes whole days or weekends in a row. If you get a rental request that might require a down payment:

1. Call the renter and find out what she'll need during the rental period. Let's say this rental will cost 500 dollars and our venue requires a 50% down payment.

2. If the renter agrees to the down payment, you can process that through Charge Renter, which is accessible through your dashboard. 

  In this case, we'll process a 250 dollar payment and add an Internal Note that it will be a down payment. When you charge the card, the renter will receive a confirmation of the charge.

3. Block out the times of the rental in your calendar to prevent double-booking. It's also good to put a reminder to collect the rest of the fee for the rental. 

4. The remaining $250 can then be collected in another Charge Renter Transaction on the day of the show to complete payment for the rental.</field>

		<field name="title">Resolving a Renter's Dispute of Credit Card Charge</field>
		<field name="content">Every now and then, a renter might not recognize the charge on their bank statement for their rental at your venue. This can sometimes leads to a charge dispute action with the bank. Understanding how our payment processor handles chargebacks will help you resolve the dispute as quickly as possible.

Organizations are contacted directly when a customer disputes a charge. 

**Note: Stripe charges a $15 fee per chargeback. (Fee is in the currency in which the funds were received.) The fee is refunded if the issuing bank decides in the organization's favor.**

 1. Stripe receives a notification of the disputed charge, sends organization automated email with the details.
 2. Stripe deducts disputed amount and fee from account.
 3. Organization responds to chargeback from their Stripe dashboard (&quot;Disputes&quot; section of their account.)
 4. Org enters evidence that the charge is legitimate and selects &quot;Respond to dispute&quot; from their dashboard.
 5. Stripe submits evidence to customer's credit card company, updates you afterwards.
 6. Fee is refunded if the org wins the dispute.
 

For more details, Stripe outlines this process in the following two support articles:

- [Disputes/Chargebacks](https://stripe.com/help/disputes)

- [How does Stripe handle chargebacks?](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-does-stripe-handle-chargebacks)

 
Here's an example of the automated email an organization would receive in the event of a chargeback: 

Subject Line: &quot;You have a disputed charge for $70.00 (ch_XxXXXXxXXXXxXxXxXXXXxXxx)&quot;

Sender: support@stripe.com

Body of message:

&quot;We're sorry to report that one of your customers has disputed a $360.00 charge (made on June 15, 2014) with his or her credit card company. Your customer is claiming that they did not receive the product or service they paid for. 
 
When one of your customers disputes a charge, we're notified by his or her bank -- which automatically refunds the transaction -- and pass on as much information to you as we receive. Since the payment has been returned to your customer, we'll deduct this amount and the dispute fee from your account within the next day. 
 
The good news is that you still have a chance to resolve the dispute and receive the amount and fee back. You can respond to the dispute through your dashboard; your customer's bank then makes the ultimate decision about how to resolve the dispute. If the dispute is resolved in your favor by your customer's bank or credit card company, we'll return both the disputed amount and the fee. 
 
Disputes are handled by your customer's bank, so we don't have any information about how specifically this payment will be reviewed. However, we do want you to have as good a chance as possible in responding to these disputes. We've put together detailed documentation that can be very helpful in understanding and responding to disputes: 
 
 https://stripe.com/help/disputes 
 
 You can also read a bit about how we recommend responding to this specific type of dispute: 
 
https://support.stripe.com/questions/dispute-product-not-received-evidence 
 
You can view all of the details about the disputed payment and respond to the dispute right from your dashboard: 
 
https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments/ch_XXXXxXxXxXXXXX 
 
We realize how frustrating this can be. You can find answers to most questions at https://support.stripe.com/, and we'll be here to help you with any step along the way. 
 
Yours,

		<field name="content">Getting a visa to work as an artist in the United States is a time-consuming and frustrating process. Government bureaucracy and red tape are a hassle, especially when you're only going to be working in the country for a short time.

As part of this lengthy process, artists applying for these visas often need letters of consultation/no objection that vouch for their artistic excellence. These can be hard to get if you're not already in a union or other professional association (and sometimes even if you are). Fractured Atlas can help.

If you're working on an O or P Visa application — whether as an immigration attorney, an employer/petitioner, or a visiting artist/group of artists — we can review your materials and write a letter of consultation/no objection for the application. We can help ALL artists and creative professionals with this process. With thousands of members across the country (and internationally), our membership represents every discipline (including, among others, the performing, visual, literary, design, and media arts).

We charge $200 for all letters. If USCIS requests further evidence after their initial review (which usually means a more specific letter of consultation), we charge $100 for the second letter.

Fractured Atlas is considered a &quot;peer group&quot; by USCIS. We are not a management or labor organization. Please check your visa application requirements to determine if you can use a peer group letter as your primary letter, or if you can only use a peer group letter as a supplement to a letter from a union or labor organization.

We can help make this process quick, easy, inexpensive, and efficient. Relevant visa application documents can be submitted online. We'll do an immediate review and send our letter of consultation within one business day.

Note that you'll need to be a member of Fractured Atlas to submit the request. If you're not already a member, you can join online for free in just a few minutes.

2.  Select the **Work With** button and select **Edit Info**

![the edit button is located under work with in people records](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=206)

Once there, you can update the patron's name, nickname, listing name, maiden name, address, image, contact information, mark a patron as deceased, and record someone's birthday. 

 ![Edit info modal](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=807 &quot;Edit info modal&quot;)

For instructions on uploading an image to a record, read [this article.](/site/knowledgebase/adding-images-to-records) Any uploaded image will trump the person's existing Gravatar, if they've got one.

### To Search for a Patron Record

You can search do a simple search for a person's name or email address. With an advanced search, you can also search by location using the zipcode and a variety of other criteria.

		<field name="content">Company records are how you keep track of your relationship with different businesses, government organizations, institutional funders, etc. They function similarly to individual people records with a couple of small differences.

## Company Types

**Company records come in five different flavors.** You will select a type when the record is first created, but it is changeable at any time.

The types are:

*   Business
*   Foundation
*   Government
*   Non-Profit
*   Other

![creating_company records](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=210)

If you want to segment your company contacts further, try using tags. [Read how here.](/site/knowledgebase/how-can-i-use-tags)

## Companies in Search

**You can include companies in your advanced search filters.** Under &quot;Type&quot; you can choose Individual or Company. Leaving it blank will include both in search results. If you select company, and additional filter will show up for &quot;Company Type&quot;.

## Converting an Individual to a Company record

**You may have some older records that are marked as individuals but are actually companies.** Making the change is easy:

1.  Select the person record in question.
2.  Click **Work With**.
3.  Choose the option **Convert to Company** at the bottom of the modal.
4.  Select the **Company Type**.
5.  Include the company's name, this will overwrite the previous name you had.

![Convert_to_Company.png](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=208)

## Importing Companies

**You can import company records into Artful.ly just like individual people records.** You can also import companies and individuals in the same spreadsheet. Just make sure to specify what type of record is in each row.For a detailed description of how to import people records visit our article: [Importing People](/site/knowledgebase/importing-people).

Note: Fractured Atlas Fiscally Sponsored Projects will automatically have any institutional funders imported as a Company Record when they [connect their Artful.ly and Fractured Atlas accounts.](/site/knowledgebase/connect-your-sponsored-project-and-artful-ly-account)

## Best Practices

**Company records are quite useful when keeping track of institutional giving and business interactions.  **Examples include:

*   An institution which you are applying for a grant
*   Businesses that give you matching gifts
*   Organizations that make significant in-kind donations
*   Vendors or contractors with whom you do business

## Upcoming Company Features

**We are still expanding the level of detail in People records.** Coming features include:

*   Defining relationships between individuals and companies
*   Householding couples and families

## How do I import patron information?

Artful.ly makes creating many People records at once easy. Just collect your patron data in a spreadsheet and follow these steps: 

1. Go to **Reports**

2. Select **Imports/Exports**

 ![reports and imports and exports are in the top menu bar](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=211 &quot;imports and exports&quot;)

3. Click **Import People**

4. Under the heading &quot;Template&quot; download an empty CSV with appropriate headers for your specific data (see below). **Important: Your files must be in CSV (comma separated-values) format in order to upload. [Learn how to save an Excel file as a CSV here.](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-HP010099725.aspx)**

5. Copy/paste the data from your old spreadsheet into the appropriate columns. Make sure to include all required fields as described under &quot;Format&quot;.

  ![Import Steps.png](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=212 &quot;Import steps&quot;)

6.  **First Name, Last Name, and Email—you must have at least one of those fields for each person you are trying to import**. If you don't have a first name, last name, or email for each row, the import won't work. All the other columns are optional.

 Note: Importing Company records requires that you include a TYPE (one of the 5 listed above) and COMPANY NAME or EMAIL instead.

7. When your CSV is ready, select **Choose File** under the header &quot;Upload&quot; and retrieve the file from your computer. Once you see the file name appear, you can select **Import**. It may take a few minutes for your contacts to be imported.

8. Once it has been processed (and there are no errors) you must click **Approve** next to the import. Depending on the size of the file, it may take a few minutes.

 ![Once the import is in, you click the approve button](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=213 &quot;click the approve button to finalize the import&quot;)

9. If any of the email addresses in your import match email addresses already in your database, then the imported information will be added to the existing record. In other words, we will merge the records for you. If any of the information in the pre-existing record conflicts with the information in the import, the existing data will win out over the new data. 

## Importing Tips

*   ****Make sure your column headers exactly match those in the blank CSV.**** For example, if your CSV has a column called just &quot;Company&quot; instead of &quot;Company Name&quot; then your file will not import properly. 
*   **Observe usable values and date formatting. **&lt;span&gt;Make sure you use the right terms (&quot;Work&quot;, &quot;&quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Cell&quot;, or &quot;Fax&quot; for phone numbers types for instance) when filling out your spreadsheet. &lt;/span&gt;
*   **Tidy up your data in the CSV before you import it.** It's much easier to fix typos and formatting in a spreadsheet rather than doing it record-by-record in the app.
*   **Artful.ly matches records based on email addresses.** Therefore, if you already have patron with the email jsmith@example.com in your account and import donation attributed to jsmith@example.com, that donation will be added to the existing record. If there is no jsmith@example.com in your account, then a new record will be created for this person.
* Up to three addresses for one person can be added during an import. On the template they're labeled Address A, Address B, and Address C. 

## Can I delete an import? 

Yes. You can recall all the People records created by an import.  Here's how:

1.  Go to **Reports**
2.  Select **Import/Export**
3.  Under the **Import History** section, click on the name of the imported file you want to recall
4.  Click the **Recall This Import** button



![recall people imports](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=215 &quot;recall people import&quot;)

Note: Recalling an import only works for People imports--not Event or Donation imports.  



## How do I get my data out of another system? 

To get your data into Artful.ly you may need to get it out of another database. We're not experts on _every_ database in the world, but here are some tips for exporting from some common systems:

*   [Save an Excel file as a CSV](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-HP010099725.aspx)

This article will help demystify how to arrange patron, event, and donation information into the correct format within these fields, so that your imports are successful.

**Important Note:** you cannot add additional fields to the template. Any information you want to include in an import that does not correspond with a provided field can be entered as a [Tag](/site/knowledgebase/how-can-i-use-tags).

## Required Field Formats

* Red highlighted cells are required information.

#### **People Imports (Individual records) **

![required fields for people imports](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=216 &quot;required columns are highlighted in red&quot;)

#### **People Imports (Company records) **

![required fields for company records](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=217 &quot;required for company records&quot;)

#### **Event Imports**

#### ![Event Import](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=219 &quot;event imports&quot;)

**Important note:** Show Dates w/o a time stamp will show up as 8pm in the Person Record. If you aren't using Excel, the date column can also be formatted like this: 2012/04/18.

#### Donation Imports

#### **![required fields for donation imports](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=220 &quot;donation imports&quot;)**

* Don't add $ or any other currency symbols to the Amount column- it will cause the import to fail. 

## The Tag Field

As mentioned above, **Tags** will allow you to attach significant information about a person that enables you to group them into a particular category. If you want to attach more then one label to a person, you can format tag fields like this: 

![tag imports](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=221 &quot;tags&quot;)

## Tips

- Don't use an Excel program? Try converting the CSV template file into a Google Doc Spreadsheet. Take a quick look at this [short video](http://screencast.com/t/mHxGh8HflZE8).

- Artful.ly doesn't check for formatting on phone numbers, so you can have phone numbers in your import template in various formats.

For example: 
- 8888888888
- 888.888.8888
- (888) 888-8888 
- etc.

With other social media sites or contact management tools, you can usually export contacts then import them to Artful.ly. Unfortunately, Facebook doesn't have an export function built in. (They tend to be a bit proprietary about data.) However, an Internet search of &quot;export Facebook friends&quot; yields a bunch of workarounds to get friend data out of Facebook. These all require going through a third-party application such as Yahoo Mail. We cannot vouch for the security of these processes or sites.

If you do use one of these tool and succeed in getting a CSV file of your friends, proceed as follows:

1.  Manipulate that CSV so the column headers match Artful.ly's as [described here.](/site/knowledgebase/importing-people)
2.  Upload and import.

Our search model is built on stringing together sentences of search criteria that you're looking for, kind of like word problems, but instead of having to calculate when two trains leaving from different cities will crash into one another, you can find information that's useful to your organization, like: 

![Example Advanced Search](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=775 &quot;Example Advanced Search&quot;)

- People who went to your shows between a specific date range.
- Who have an email address
- Have purchased tickets for a specific show
- And volunteered to help your organization between a date range.

There's a lot more you can search for, and the best way to learn is to play around with your own CRM data to see what you can find, so here are some tips to help you get started. We're excited to see what you can come up with and what you find.

## Match Results to Any or All

One of the first things you'll want to consider when building a new search is how you want the search to run. For starters, you need to define how you want people to match up to your search. There are two options:

- *Any* searches cast a wide net. When you do one of these searches, results will come back if anyone in your CRM fits even just one of your conditions. So if you have a search for 4 different sentences, anyone who fits at lease one of your terms will be in the results. 
- *All* searches are laser-focused. Here the results will only include people who fit all of your search conditions. If you search for 4 different conditions and perform an all search, only people who meet all 4 will be returned. 

## Search Conditions

Once you have your match criteria set, you get to start building your search; we refer to the blocks of your searches as conditions. A full list of conditions is found in this article [Advanced Search Conditions Glossary]()

Different kits give you different conditions to search with. MailChimp, memberships, passes, relationships, fundraising campaigns add have their own specific search filters that appear when those kits are added to your account. This keeps your conditions list uncluttered and relevant to your organization's activities.

## Double, Triple, or even Quadruple Negative!
Sure, you can search for people who have done things, but oftentimes it's just as useful to know those who *have not* done something. For those moments, you can make your search conditions negative. For example, you could build a search for people who:

- *Went* your gala. (you would use the date the event happened in your search condition) 
and
- *Did not buy* a ticket to your first show of the season 
So you can send them a customized email letting them know tickets are available. 

Nearly every condition has negative search option, so you can use them in combination to find just who you're looking for. 
 ![An example of a search built with all negative conditions](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=772 &quot;a search for opportunities&quot;)

## I've searched for something, now what?

After you've admired how clever your search is, you'll probably want to take some action on it. For that you'll use the **Work With** button on the right hand side of your search results. 

 ![An expanded view of the items in the work with button in Advanced Search](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=773 &quot;work with button in advanced search&quot;) 

The options are: 

- **Tag All** This adds a tag to everyone in your search results. Learn more in [How can I use tags?](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/how-can-i-use-tags) 
- **Log Action** This adds a bulk action to everyone in your search results. More can be found in [Actions &amp; the Action Feed](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/actions-the-action-feed) 
- **Create List Segment** Lets you save a search. List segments deserve a little more explanation, so we'll cover them in the next section.
- **Export to CSV** Lets you export a copy of your people records as a comma separated value file so you can work with it in another application.
- **Comp Memberships** If you have the memberships kit, this allows you to comp memberships in bulk. There's more on that in [Comp Memberships](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/beta-comp-memberships) 
- **Subscribe to MailChimp list** Adds people to your MailChimp Lists. Read more about how this works in [Adding people to MailChimp lists or groups.](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/adding-people-to-mailchimp-lists-or-groups) 
- **Subscribe to MailChimp list group** Same as above, but for groups within lists. 

## What is a list segment?
You might be wondering what we mean by a list segment. In essence, list segments are dynamic saved searches that you can return to at a later time. 

For example, if you create  a list segment for everyone who has a VIP tag and donated more than $150 since January of 2015, you'll be able to save that search; and as more people donate and get tagged as a VIP, that list segment will grow to reflect the new people who meet your conditions the next time you return to it. 

Once you've created a list segment, you can return to it in the people menu at the top of Artful.ly.

![An expanded people menu with an arrow pointing to list segments](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=774 &quot;list segments&quot;)

		<field name="title">How can I use tags?</field>
		<field name="content">Tags are custom identifiers you can attach to a People Record. Where they really shine is when you use the same tag to identify a unique group of people. People with the same tag can be easily found with advanced search and monitored via list segments. This can help you target your communication or track donor groups.

## What makes a good tag?

Tags are best used for classifications that are unique to your organization and/or that individual or company. Only letters, number, or dashes allowed in tags. Some examples include:

* &quot;Board-Member&quot;
* &quot;VIP&quot;
* &quot;Artist&quot;
* Discipline Interests (e.g. &quot;Dance&quot;, &quot;Theater&quot;, &quot;Opera&quot;, &quot;Film&quot;)
* Custom Company Classifications (e.g. &quot;Theater-Company&quot;, &quot;Gallery&quot;, &quot;Producer&quot;, &quot;Presenter&quot;, &quot;Vendor&quot;)

You do not need to create tags for things like state or &quot;2012-Gala-Ticket&quot; since location and event are both advanced search filters of their own.

## Creating a Tag

1.  Open **People** from the top menu bar 
2.  Select **Search** (if the Person Record already exists), or **New Contact**
3.  Type in the name of the tag in the field provided. Remember--use only letters, numbers, and dashes.
4.  Select the **Add Tag** button

Note: When viewing a Person Record, you can click on a tag in order to view the entire list of people in your database who have that tag.  
 ![people record](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=226 &quot;people record&quot;)

## Tag a Bunch of People At Once  
  
Using [Advanced Search](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/advanced-search-list-segments), you can give the same tag to a group of people with one click.

1.  Open **Advanced Search** from the People drop down menu in the top navigation bar
2.  Build your search using the search conditions.
3.  Click the **Work With** button
4.  Select **Tag All** from the drop down menu that appears
5.  Type the name of your new tag in the pop-up field that appear
  
 ![Advanced Searches being used to tag all search results from the work with button](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=728 &quot;tag all&quot;)

## Edit or Delete a Tag

Tags can be edited or deleted from the Tags List.

1.  Go to the **People** section and select **Tags List** from the drop down menu.
2.  Click on the Tag name to view the list of patrons who are tagged in that segment.
3.  Click on **Edit** to change the name of the tag. This will update every person's record who has that tag.
4.  Click on **Delete** to remove the tag. This will delete the tag from every person's record who has that tag.
5.  To delete only one tag from an individual Person Record, view the record, hover over the tag, and click on the red X.

		<field name="content">Notes are pieces of information you can log for reference on a People Record. They are best used for recording observations about a patron or organization, their preferences, or bits of prospect research.

This section of a People Record is free-form. It houses whatever details you deem relevant to doing business with this person that don't fit into action. Basically, notes can be used to document anything from general patron housekeeping to fun facts about that person that will help you make your next conversation with that person a little bit more personal. 

If you click on a note, and then click on the Edit button, you'll see more details about which user created the note and when.

You can also star important notes. Only the first three starred notes will show up on the top of a People Record, but the rest will appear when you click the &quot;X more notes&quot; link.

Artful.ly will still keep track of the purchase and add it to the show/event info including number and type of ticket sold, and amount of earned income. Because no specific patron information is attached to the sale, however, Artful.ly places the purchase into your Anonymous record. You can either leave them all there or assign them to a patron later. Prevention, of course, is always the best cure. 

**Make sure you ask for a patron's name and email address when they buy tickets at the box office so your records are clear and they receive a receipt for the transaction.**

![anonymous record](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=231 &quot;anonymous record&quot;)

Note: Anonymous records often show a very high lifetime value since they are a compilation of many different people.

### Finding Your Anonymous Record

**You can find your Anonymous record through the people menu under search.** Type in ANONYMOUS and the record will appear.

### Reassigning an Action from Anonymous to Another People Record

**If you know who made a purchase that was recorded under your Anonymous Record, you can reassign the action.**

1.  Select the action.
2.  Click **View Order Details**.
3.  Click the **Work With...** button in the top left corner.
4.  Choose **Assign Person**.
5.  Select which patron you would like to be assigned the action.

Voila!

		<field name="title">What happens if patrons mistype their email addresses?</field>
		<field name="content">If a patron makes an order and mistypes her email address, the purchase will still complete and the patron will be added to your door list. Fixing it is super easy:

1.  [Correct the email address on the patron's record.](/site/knowledgebase/edit-information-on-people-records)
2.  [Resend the Order Confirmation](/site/knowledgebase/resending-receipts).

This is one of the hardest design choices to make with a ticketing software. Because the room for human error on any online form is high—and any error that prevents checking out increases the probability the patron won't try again—Artful.ly errs on the side of letting patrons check out so they can still get to your event. Patrons who mistype their emails—but still check out—will be listed on your door list, so even if a patron enters a wrong email address, she can still check in at your event and see your work.

With paid tickets, the patron will usually contact you to double-check if the purchase was successful before attempting to purchase again. When this happens, you can [correct the email address](/site/knowledgebase/edit-information-on-people-records) on the patron record and an [order confirmation may be resent](/site/knowledgebase/resending-receipts). This information can also be corrected at the door or post-event.

We agree that it's annoying to have misspelled email addresses created in your CRM, but because it's something that can be fixed at a later time, we want to make it as easy as possible for your patrons to attend your event and see your work, rather than have the relationship stop at the ticket buying process.

In our experience, typos in emails effect a small number of patrons compared to the overall audience, and sometimes correcting the information can present an opportunity to deepen a relationship with a patron.

1.

3.  Select the **Work With Button**.
4.  Choose **Merge**.
5.  Type the name or e-mail address of the winner into search field at the top of the page. You can also select the record from the list or recently opened records that will appear on the right.
6.  Confirm the merge (or cancel if you messed up).

		<field name="content">**The Box Office is a private sales channel you and your staff can use to sell tickets at the door or over the phone.** It also provides easy access to your Door List to check in patrons as they arrive. There are no ticket fees applied to Box Office sales. You only pay the credit card processing fee if you sell tickets via card.

## To Reach the Box Office:

1.  Select the **Event** and **Show** you are selling tickets for. If you are selling tickets to the next upcoming show, you will see the box office button available on your Event Dashboard under **Next Showing**.
2.  Select the** Box Office** button from the shaded grey area underneath the show date and time.
 ![navigating to the box office](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=238 &quot;navigating to the box office&quot;)

## To Sell Tickets:

1.  **Select a Ticket Type and choose how many tickets to sell in the order.** If you have activated a donation kit or created discount codes, you will see options to add a **Donation** or apply a **Discount Code** to the order.  

    ![box office ticket selectors](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=235 &quot;box office ticket selectors&quot;)  

2.  **Select the Payment Type: Cash, Credit, Check, or Comp.** Various fields for payment details and Buyer Info fields will be displayed depending on the payment type you select.  

    *   **Cash** payments do not require any patron information, but recording a name or email is always encouraged.
    *   **Credit Card** payments require a patron's name and either an email address or phone number.
    *   **Check** payments allow you to record the check number.
    *   **Comp **payments are great for logging complementary tickets given to press, staff, friends, and family. We suggest recording a reason for the comp in the Order Notes field. Comp tickets will not send an email notification to the patron unless you select the checkbox to send the fan a confirmation email.

3.  **Complete the required payment details and Buyer Info fields.** When you start to type in the patron's name or email, Artful.ly will suggest existing people in your records. If you select one of these suggested matches, the rest of the fields will autofill for you. This will also help prevent duplicate records.  

    ![box office checkout fields](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=236 &quot;box office checkout fields&quot;)  

4.  **Choose whether to check in the patron or not**. Checking in a patron marks him/her as attended on Door List and adds a Went Actionto the patron's People Record.  

    ![box office checkout button](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=806 &quot;checkout button with mark as received and confirmation options&quot;)  

5.  **Hit the Checkout button.**

## Receipts

An email order confirmation will be sent for sales conducted through the Box Office if the patron's email is entered or in your records. For comp sales, you need to check the box that's labeled &quot;Send individual confirmation of this comp.&quot;  In general, it's a good idea to send an email confirmation for comp orders, especially if you're using the print-at-home scannable tickets kit. If you have a case where sending a confirmation email would be confusing you can leave the box unchecked.

## Credit Card Readers

If you want to make your door sales go even faster, get a USB credit card reader. These generic devices are available from places like Amazon.com for $20-$50. We've tested the **Magtek SureSwipe Card Reader 21040145** and can vouch for that model. 

Plug the USB card reader into your desktop or laptop USB port, then select the Credit Card payment type in the Box Office interface, and swipe a credit card. The card number and expiration date will get pulled into the appropriate fields. This improves speed and accuracy. 

Artful.ly does not currently support card readers for mobile devices. If this feature is a priority for you, show your support in our [Feature Request Forum](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/feature_request_list).

Beyond offering a member price for a ticket, you may also want to host an event or shows open exclusively to your members. 

**To Create Member-Only Events:**

These events are only visible when your members are logged into your storefront. 

1.  Create an event.
2.  Under **Event Details**, select **About**.
3.  Check the **Members Only** checkbox and **Save**.  

    ![Member Only Event](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=240 &quot;Member Only Event&quot;)
4.  Proceed through the rest of your event set up.

The events will display when a member is logged into the members-only storefront.

  ![Member Storefront](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=242 &quot;Member Storefront&quot;)

**To Create Member-Only Shows:**

These shows are visible to the public but the only tickets available are member-only tickets.

1.  Create an event with a member ticket type.
2.  Select the type of membership the ticket type is available to.
3.  Do not create any ticket types that are not member-only.

**Some More Options:**

*   If you make a member ticket type and leave the **Storefront and Widgets** availability box checked, the ticket type will be visible to anyone who visits your storefront. The member only ticket type will appear _Sold Out_ to non-members. Members will need to log into your storefront to add these tickets to the cart.
*   If **Storefront and Widgets **is unchecked, but the **Members **box is checked (see image below), the ticket type will only be visible when members are logged into your storefront.
*   Leaving **Box Office** checked will allow your Box Office staff  to sell this ticket type over the phone and at the door. Box office sales of member tickets are not restricted, so box office staff may need to check if the patron is a member in your CRM, or offer to sell the patron a membership using the Sales Console.

Member-only ticket types allow you to set up a ticket type exclusively for your members. These tickets can either be discounted or free.

**To create a member ticket type**:

1.  Add a new **Ticket Type**
2.  Under **Member Ticket** select **Yes**
3.  Define how many tickets a single member may purchase in a transaction
4.  Choose where the ticket is **Visible**

*   **Storefront &amp; Widgets**: Selecting this checkbox makes the member ticket type visible in your public storefront. Member-only ticket types will appear in the public storefront appear as &quot;Sold Out&quot; until the member logs in.
*   **Box Offic**e: This checkbox makes this ticket available in the box office so your staff can sell the ticket over the phone or at the door. Box office staff should check the patron's member record in the CRM to verify a membership.
*   **Members**: This checkbox causes the ticket type to appear when the member is logged in. To make a ticket type only visible to members, you should check this box, and leave Storefront &amp; Widgets unchecked.

## To Purchase Member-Only Tickets

With the Membership Kit activated, your patrons will see a **Member Login** button in the upper right corner of your Storefront, along with an option to **Become a Member**. Once a member logs in, member-only ticket types become available.

		<field name="content">**If you have Internet access available at your venue, you can check in your patrons as they arrive through the Door List.** The Door List integrates with the Box Office, so you can sell tickets and check in patrons as they arrive.

## To Access the Door List

Select the **Event** and **Show** you want to check people in for. If you are checking in patrons to your next show. There are two ways to access the door list.

1.  When clicking on your event you'll see a door list button under **Next Show**.  

    ![navigate to door list through next show](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=247 &quot;navigate to door list&quot;)

2.  Or if you need to view the door list for a later show, click on **Shows **and then **List**.

 ![list view](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=248 &quot;list view&quot;)  

You can then click on the show date, and use the **Work With **button to find the door list.

 ![work with door list](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=249 &quot;work with door list&quot;)

## Using the Door List

Here you can see every person who has purchased tickets for the show.   

 ![viewing the door list](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=250 &quot;viewing the door list&quot;)

## **To View an Order:**

1.  Click on the patron's name to see their order in the left column.
2.  Click the **Check Box** for each member of the patron's party present. You can leave a box unchecked if someone hasn't arrived, yet. Checking this box adds a **Went Action** to that patron's record.
3.  As you check in patrons, you'll see the bar fill at the top of the screen; this shows your **total attendance**. The circle next to the patron's name will also begin to fill as you check in patrons. A half circle is partially checked-in, and a black circle indicates a fully checked-in party.  

    ![partial check in](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=251 &quot;partial check in&quot;)

## But Wait, There's More...

*   The **Sell Tickets** Button makes it easy to switch back and forth between your **Door List** and the **Box Office**
*   You can **Download** the door list  as a PDF or CSV. This is useful if you don't have internet access at your venue, or if you need to perform an export to email all of your ticket buyers.   

    ![sell tickets and download door list](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=252 &quot;sell tickets and download door list&quot;)

Additionally, you'll also receive a copy of the door list in your email 90 minutes before showtime. Here's what the email looks like:

![90 Minutes Before Showtime Email Example](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=624 &quot;Door List Email&quot;)

This way you'll always have a backup in your email inbox. Organization Administrators are automatically set to receive these emails, but other staff members can, as well. If you'd like to have additional staff members receive the door list, or to turn the feature off for your email, check out this article: [Adding Users &amp; Managing User Permissions](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/adding-users-managing-user-permissions-).

		<field name="content">The Artful.ly iOS app can be used on its own to check patrons in to your events using the door list. It's basically the same door list you see on your computer rolled up into a handy mobile app. This functionality is described below.

The Artful.ly iOS app can also be used in conjunction with the Scannable Ticketing Kit to scan the QR codes on patrons' tickets to expedite check-in. Scanning functionality is described in [this article](/site/knowledgebase/the-artful-ly-app-scan-tickets-with-your-iphone-or-ipod-touch).

## Download the App

The Artful.ly app is available in the iOS App Store.

 [Download it here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/artful.ly/id862530729?mt=8)

## Log In

Log in to the app using your Artful.ly account credentials.

 ![Artful.ly app sign in](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=279 &quot;sign in&quot;)

## Events List

Once logged in you'll see your **Events List**. The top portion of the screen will list every show your organization has scheduled today, along with a list of all of your upcoming events.

 ![events list](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=280 &quot;events list&quot;)

Tapping the name of an event will take you to a list of all the scheduled shows in that event.

 ![show list](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=281 &quot;show list&quot;)

## Scan Screen

Tapping a show date will take you to the scan screen, which shows you the view from your device's camera. You won't have anything to scan here unless you've activated the Scannable Ticketing Kit and your patrons are presenting their QR codes at the door. [Read more about that here.](/site/knowledgebase/print-at-home-scannable-tickets-kit)

Even without the Scannable Ticketing Kit turned on, there's useful info on this page. The fraction on middle left side of the screen is the check-in count. It shows the number of tickets checked-in over the number of tickets sold to that show. Tap **View Door List** to see your ticket holders.

 ![view door list](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=286 &quot;view door list&quot;)

## Door List 

Tapping on **View Door List** will show you every ticket buyer for the show.

![notes on the door list](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=283 &quot;notes on door list&quot;)

 When viewing the Door List, **swiping to the left** on the &quot;**&gt;**&quot; icon next to the &quot;i&quot; allows you to check in an entire order.

![swipe to check in](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=285 &quot;swipe to check in&quot;)

## Order Details Screen

You can access the order details for any patron from the door list screen by tapping on the **(i)**, or by touching the patron's name after a successful ticket scan.

Tickets can be checked in or out individually from an Order Details screen.

**Special Instructions** and **Order Notes** are also found in a customer's Order Details. If a ticket buyer has either, it will be indicated with an exclamation point inside a yellow triangle on the Door List.

![special instructions in app](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=287 &quot;special instructions&quot;)

## Pro Tips

*   When checking in a party with one large order, it's often easier to scan one ticket, and then tap on the name on the order to go to the order details screen. You can then quickly tap the Check in button for the rest of the tickets on the order.
*   Take a beat between scanning tickets.There is a small pause between consecutive ticket scans. This is intended to help keep track of check-ins.

		<field name="title">Beta: How Patrons Become Members</field>
		<field name="content">With the Membership Kit activated, you will have four channels through which your fans can become members.

1.  A patron can buy her own membership on your public Storefront
2.  You can sell a patron an membership via the Sales Console
3.  You can give a single patron a complementary membership via their People Record
4.  You can give several people complementary memberships through Advanced Search and List Segments

## 1) Membership Storefront

When you activate the Membership Kit you'll find a new **Become a Member** item in the navigation bar of your Storefront. You will also see a new Member Login link in the upper-right corner of the Storefront navigation bar.  

  ![Demo Member Bar](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=244 &quot;Demo Member Bar&quot;)

When a patron clicks **Become a Member** they are taken to your Membership Storefront. The process for buying a membership follows similar conventions to purchasing tickets to a show. A patron selects a membership, adds it to his cart, and then checks out.

  ![Become a Member](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=253 &quot;Become a Member&quot;)

## 2) Sales Console

It's also possible to sell memberships through the Sales Console:

1.  Select the Memberships tile.  

    ![Membership Sales Console](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=254 &quot;Membership Sales Console&quot;)
2.  Select the Membership Type.  

    ![Add Memberships](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=255 &quot;Add Memberships&quot;)
3.  Click the **Check Out** tile to add payment information. The Sales Console checkout process will feel very similar to the Box Office.

## 3) Comping a Single Membership

1.  Find the individual's People Record
2.  Select **Work With**
3.  Choose **Comp Membership** from the drop down menu.

## 4) Bulk Comping Memberships

1.  Select a pre-existing List Segment or use Advanced Search to define a group of people
2.  Click **Work With**
3.  Choose **Comp Memberships** from the drop down menu.

## What Happens Next? 

When a patron buys a membership they receive two emails: 

1.  **Order Confirmation:** This is the patron's receipt. It's sent from support@artful.ly. Nothing fancy here.
2.  **Membership Instructions:** This email includes a link to a page where the new member can create a password to access member-only events and tickets. You can also customize some text in this email from the [Membership Kit Configuration page](/site/knowledgebase/beta-configure-your-membership-storefront). The reply-to address on this email is whatever you've set up as your general organization contact email. The line after the salutation contains the optional custom message from when you created the membership type.  

    ![Membership Confirmation Email](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=256 &quot;Membership Confirmation Email&quot;)
3.  **Membership Card: **Your Patrons will also receive a Membership Card as an email attachment. The Membership Card may be scanned with the Artful.ly App to check patrons into events. 

## Pro Tips

*   You may want add a link to the Member Sign In page on your site. This way your patrons can easily log in to see member events and tickets.
*   It's a good idea to include some custom text in your welcome email if your organization plans to use Membership Cards.

## Storefront

1.  Member logs in to your organization's storefront and can see member ticket types and prices.
2.  Member purchases the tickets independently.

 ![Member Storefront](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=242 &quot;Member Storefront&quot;)

## Sales Console

For more complicated over-the-phone orders, you can sell member tickets through the Sales Console:

1.  Search for the person's record to verify the membership.
2.  On the record, click ***Work With** and **Sell to**.  

    ![Member Sell To](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=268 &quot;Member Sell To&quot;)
3.  You'll then be taken to the **Sales Console** to complete the sale. The person's contact information from the record will automatically populate in the checkout screen.

## Box Office

Member tickets at the door are best sold through the Box Office:

1.  Search for the patron's **People Record** and verify the membership.
2.  Then you can sell the member ticket via the Box Office according to your organization's business rules for membership.

## Member Card

If a member has printed her member card, he/she can present this just like a ticket. You can scan the card at the door and the member's tickets will be checked into the door list.

If a member has not purchased tickets in advance and the event has free tickets for members, then you can scan a patron's member card. This will sell a free ticket to the member and check them in with one scan.

## Scan Validation Messages

When scanning a ticket or Membership Card you will see one of these three messages:

1.  **Success** appears if the ticket is validated; the guideline box will turn green. If you see this message—great. The ticket has been checked in.  

      ![ticket scan success](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=297)
2.  **Ticket is already validated** appears in red if the ticket has already been scanned.   

    ![ticket already validated](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=298 &quot;Ticket already validated&quot;)

*   Take a beat between scanning tickets.There is a small pause between when tickets can be scanned. This is intended to help keep track of how many tickets you have checked in. 
*   It's possible to scan a QR code off a patron's phone, but the brightness on a patron's device must be turned up high in order to scan it.

		<field name="content">## Internal Notes vs. Special Instructions

Bottom Line: Internal Notes and Special Instructions both appear on your Door List. Special Instructions are written by the ticket buyer, while Internal Notes are written by you, the producer. 

## Special Instructions   

Special Instructions are responses patrons submit through the check out process. This will only happen if you have turned on Special Instructions for the event. See [Asking a Question at Checkout](/site/knowledgebase/ask-patrons-a-question-at-checkout)

*   Special Instructions cannot be edited after the tickets have been purchased. If a response changes, you should note that in an Internal Note.

## Internal Notes

You can make internal notes on Order Details or through internal sales channels like the Box Office and Sales Console. 

![adding internal notes in the box office](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=302 &quot;adding internal notes in the box office&quot;)

Or by finding the **Order Details** for a purchase and clicking the **+ Internal Note** Button.  

![Add internal note](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=825 &quot;edit order notes&quot;)

Making an Internal Note is useful for:

*   Noting when patron transfers her ticket to someone else

## Train Box Office Staff on &quot;Fake&quot; Events
**Designate a practice event and use it repeatedly for box office training purposes. **This will help you and your staff get the hang of selling tickets without messing up financial reports for actual productions. And practice will improve your efficiency with &quot;live&quot; ticket sales.

1. Create an event and name it &quot;Fake&quot; or &quot;Test&quot;.
2. Add shows and ticket types to that event so you can simulate sales.

**What types of actions can one practice using a fake event?**

*   Execute sales with each payment type including comps.
*   [Exchange and refund tickets](/site/knowledgebase/refund-exchange-and-return-tickets).
*   [Resend Receipts](/site/knowledgebase/resending-receipts)

## Open a Separate Window for People Records
**Make sure you can easily navigate back and forth between the Box Office screen and People records. **This allows you to add a quick note to your patron's record for future reference. That's the beauty of a [CRM](/site/knowledgebase/what-is-a-crm-and-why-do-i-need-one)! It also affords you a ninja-like ability to troubleshoot ticket confusion. For example:

A patron shows up at the door and they are not on the door list. Before they bat an eyelash, you search their name or email in your People records, and find out exactly what happened with their alleged purchase.

## Verbally Confirm Ticket Orders and Credit Card Numbers
**Repeat an order back to your patron before finalizing the sale:  **&quot;That's 2 tickets at $20 for 7:30 tomorrow night, correct?&quot;

**Why is this important? **

*   With a [USB Swiper](/site/knowledgebase/box-office-sell-tickets-at-the-door), the card is automatically charged the second you swipe. There is no &quot;Sell&quot; button to confirm the sale afterwards. 
*   When manually entering a credit card number, it's a good idea to repeat the credit card number back to the patron especially when selling over the phone
*   Correcting an erroneous sale takes time you don't have during the pre-show rush. 
*   You'll sound like a customer service rock star. Everyone loves efficiency!

## Setting Up the Donation Storefront

1.  Upload a **header image**. The image size is limited to 1MB. We recommend that your image be at least 300 pixels wide, and either a .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, or .png file format. This image can be changed at any time.
2.  Describe your organization's activities, mission, and/or goals to potential patrons in the **About Your Organization** section. Add an image by uploading it from your computer.
3.  Draft an appeal in the **Donation Ask for Storefront** section.   

    ![configure fields](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=594 &quot;configure fields&quot;)

4.  Choose a name for the **Navigation Button**. This can be customized to something like, &quot;Give,&quot; &quot;Support,&quot; or &quot;Donate.&quot;
5.  Add an appeal to shopping carts with the **Donation Nudge for Cart** section. You'll see default text in this space, but it can be customized. We recommend keeping it short and sweet.  

    ![configure fields part 2](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=314 &quot;configure fields part 2&quot;)

6. Add option for donors to include **special instructions.** This section appears in the cart so that a patron can add instructions for his or her gift to your organization.

7.  Set up **Suggested Gifts**. This is optional. You also have the option to display an **open gift** field. Leaving this box checked allows donors to enter an amount of their choosing.
8.  To add more levels, enter the **level name** and **$ amount** in the empty field and click add. New levels will only be added if every field is filled in.  

    ![configure fields part 3](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=315 &quot;configure fields part 3&quot;)

9.  Add a **Thanks Message** and an **Email Message** that patrons will see when they've completed their order and in the confirmation email that they receive. Keep in mind that you'll still need to send them a tax receipt for their records.
10.  Do you want the **Donation Storefront** to be visible in your **Central Storefront**? Check this last box before saving your details. This is optional, &lt;span&gt;you don't need to make it public in order to take donations with the Artful.ly widget or on top of ticket orders.&lt;/span&gt;
11.  While on the configure page, you can click on the donation storefront link to preview what it will look like. 

Here's what a completed Donation Storefront could look like:

## Q: How do I connect my Artful.ly account to Fractured Atlas?
**A:** Select the **connect now** link from your **Account Administration** page. **[Read here](/site/knowledgebase/connect-your-sponsored-project-and-artful-ly-accounty)** if you need help connecting.

## Q: What happens when a donor contributes via Artful.ly?
**A: **The money from donations made via Artful.ly will show up immediately in your sponsored fund on the Fractured Atlas site. Those donations are treated like any other donation coming into your project via Fractured Atlas.

*   Fractured Atlas takes 7% of the donation as an administrative fee. There are no extra credit card fees from Artful.ly for your donations.
*   Donations immediately show up in your current fund balance on the Fractured Atlas website, and become available for release after 7 calendar days.
*   Fractured Atlas will issue a tax receipt to your donors, which will be emailed to them immediately following their transaction.
*   If a patron buys a ticket and adds a donation at the same time, there will be two charges on their credit card statement—one for the ticket from &quot;Artful.ly&quot; and one for the donation &quot;Fractured Atlas.&quot;
*   All donations are managed according to the [Fiscal Sponsorship guidelines](http://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/?do=manage) outlined in your Program Manual. 

## Q: How do I get my donation money acquired through Artful.ly?
**A:** Just submit a &quot;Fund Release Request&quot; via your My Fiscal Sponsorship page.

* If you'd like your Fractured Atlas donation money to go into the same bank account that your ticketing revenue goes to, fill out this [Fractured Atlas EFT Form](https://www.artful.ly/forms/artfully_etf_sign_up.pdf) and e-mail it to support@fracturedatlas.org. This way the money from your ticket sales and your donation money will end up in the same place, just at different times.

## Q: What about new donations by check or via the Fractured Atlas website?
**A:** Any new donations that are logged in your sponsored fund history will be exported Artful.ly and recorded there too. Artful.ly checks for new donations in your sponsored fund every hour. When a new donor is imported into Artful.ly you can edit their contact information, add tags, and make notes on their Artful.ly People Record, but those changes will not be reflected on the Fractured Atlas side.

- [How can my fans make online donations?](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/how-can-my-fans-make-online-donations)

Once you have donations in your Artful.ly there are a number of ways you can find your donations, gain new insights about your donor base, and work with that information.

## Donation Alerts

There are a couple ways that you can ensure you and your colleagues are notified when your organization receives a donation via Artful.ly.

- [Daily Sales Reports](/site/knowledgebase/daily-sales-report) are sent to the Organization Administrator and whomever else is listed as a recipient. This is a summary of all orders and donations made to your organization for the day.
- Email alerts when a donation is made. From your **Account Administration** page under **Users**, the Organization Administrator can select who should receive an email notification when a patron donates to your organization. Read [Adding Users &amp; Managing User Permissions](/site/knowledgebase/adding-users-managing-user-permissions-) for more detailed instructions.

## Advanced Search
Searching for your donors through Advanced Search lets you looking for donors in combination with other useful information, like actions, ticket purchases, membership status, tags, and a whole lot more. Here's where you'll find out a lot more about your audience.

Advanced search is found in the people menu.

![A close up view of the people menu with an arrow pointing to Advanced Search](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=767 &quot;advanced search&quot;) 

From there you can build an advanced search for your desired donor search. 
![An example of an advanced search for donations between 26 and 78 dollars](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=765 &quot;Advanced Search for Donations&quot;)
For more information on building your advanced searches check out these articles: 

- [Advanced Search](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/advanced-search-list-segments)
- [Advanced Search Conditions Glossary](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/advanced-search-conditions-glossary)

## Donation Reports
Donation reports can get you a list of anyone who has donated during a certain time period, along with their order numbers and links to their order details.

This is often more convenient than an advanced search for when you just need everyone who's donated you in a certain time period. For example, order reports are very useful when you want to pull all donations from the last month so you can send out acknowledgment letters and tax receipts.

Donation reports can be found in the orders menu at the top of Artful.ly. Date ranges can be specified, and by using the work with button, you can export your report as a CSV to work with in another application.

![The donation reports page with an arrow pointing to where to find donation reports in the Orders menu](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=764 &quot;donation reports&quot;)

## Exporting All Donations
Sometimes you just need everything all at once. That's what exporting your donation list is for. Exporting all donations gives you essentially the same information as a donations report, but instead of a specific time period, you get every donation logged in your Artful.ly account.

		<field name="content">## How do I import Donations?
Artful.ly makes it easy to add your old donation records to your Artful.ly account in one fell swoop. Just collect your donation records in a spreadsheet and follow these steps: 

1. Go to **Reports**.

2. Select **Imports/Exports**.

 ![Imports and Exports](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=320 &quot;imports and exports&quot;)

3. Select **Import Donations**.

4. Under the heading &quot;Template&quot; download an empty CSV file with appropriate headers for event imports.  **Important: Your files must be in CSV (comma separated-values) format in order to upload them into Artful.ly. [Learn how to save an Excel file as a CSV here.](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-HP010099725.aspx)

5. Copy/paste the data from your old spreadsheet into the appropriate columns. Make sure to include all required fields as described under &quot;Format&quot;.

 ![import donations](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=321 &quot;import donations&quot;)

6. **Date and Donation type** are mandatory fields. If you don't have that data filled in, the import won't work. If you are missing this information, either leave that record out of your spreadsheet, or fill in the field with a place holder. For example (&quot;company name&quot;, &quot;company&quot; could be a substitute for &quot;first name&quot;, &quot;last name&quot;)

7. When your CSV is ready, select **Choose File **under the header &quot;Upload&quot; and retrieve the file from your computer. Once you see the file name appear, you can select **Import**. It may take a few minutes for your contacts to be imported.

8. Once it has been processed (and there are no errors) you must **approve** the import. Depending on the size of the file, it may take a few minutes.

 ![approving imports](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=322 &quot;approving imports&quot;)

## Importing Tips
*   **Make sure your column headers match those in the blank CSV.** If your file is not organized properly or the information is in the wrong place (email in the wrong column, for instance), you will receive an error message. We recommend you delete the file and adjust the spreadsheet appropriately before uploading it again.
*   **Observe usable values and date formatting. **Make sure you use the right terms (CASH or CREDIT CARD in Payment Methods for instance) when filling out your spreadsheet. Also, observe the specific formatting for dates so your donations are recorded on the right date.  
*   **Tidy up your data in the CSV before you import it.** It's much easier to fix typos and formatting here doing it record-by-record in the app.

## Can I delete an import? 
It is not yet possible to delete a whole batch of imported donations. Please exercise a great deal of caution before importing a donation and make sure you double check your work.

**If you are fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas you MUST log donations on the Fractured Atlas website.** They will be automatically synchronized into your Artful.ly account. Do not manually enter donations directly into your Artful.ly account.

**If you are a 501(c)(3), the [501(c)(3) Donations Kit](/site/knowledgebase/enabling-donations-for-501-c-3-nonprofits) allows you to manually log a donation from a people record.** You should manually log any donations made via check, cash, another credit card processor, or in-kind donations. You do not need to enter donations made via an Artful.ly widget or Storefront--the system will automatically log those on the appropriate People record for you. To manually log a donation:

1. Find the donor's People record
2. Next to the Action Feed,select the **Add** button
3. Click the **Gave** button
4. Fill in the contribution details:

*   **Type:** Monetary, or In-kind.
*   **Payment**: Cash, Credit, Check, or Other.
*   **Deductible Amount**: Usually the total dollar amount given, or the monetary value of an in-kind donation.
*   **Non-Deductible Amount**: If the donor received a service or item in exchange for their gift, then the fair market value of that service or item is the non-deductible portion of the gift.
*   **Date and Time**: The date is important for your reporting purposes. You can estimate the time.
*   **Notes**: Use this to record any other information about this specific gift.

##Importing Donations
501(c)(3) charities can also import lists of past donations. [Read this article for instructions on importing donations.](/site/knowledgebase/importing-donations)

##Donation Alerts
Donations are so exciting! You'll want to make sure that you know when they come in so you can do a happy dance and thank your donor right away. Artful.ly tells you when it receives a new donation in these ways:

1.  **Recent Activity Feed on your Dashboard**: The feed on your Dashboard is a real-time bulletin of every interaction a patron has with your organization. It's good practice to skim this feed every time you login and see if you got any new donations. By the way, if you manually enter a past donation, it will calculate the time-stamp based on the date you entered in the contribution details.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

2.  [**Daily Sales Report Email**](/site/knowledgebase/daily-sales-report): An email is sent to your Organization Administrator and whomever she has listed as a recipient. This email summarizes all ticket sales and received donations from the previous day.

3. **Donation Alert Email**: An email is sent to the Organization Administrator and whomever she has listed as a recipient. This email is sent any time you receive a donation via Artful.ly

The recipients of the aforementioned email reports can be selected by the account's Organization Administrator on the Account Administration page.

![Send user daily email](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=610 &quot;Send user daily email&quot;)

You can also use [Advanced Search](/site/knowledgebase/advanced-search-and-list-segments) to find donations made in a specific date range and/or dollar amount range. Or you can click Transactions, then Contributions in the top menu bar to see a list of all donations.

## Send Acknowledgements

When someone makes a donation via Artful.ly, the donor will automatically receive an order confirmation email summarizing the transaction. In addition to this, you should mail or email your donors directly to thank them. They need this written acknowledgement to take a tax deduction for their donation. Thanking them in writing is also a chance to you to tell them what you're organization is up to and build a more substantial relationship with them.

You don't want to forget to send this letter so we created a tool to make it easy for your to record when you sent that acknowledgement—just open up the donor's People record and [log a Hear Action](/site/knowledgebase/actions-the-action-feed).

*   **If you are sure of the donation amount or time range:** Check the [Orders](/site/knowledgebase/transaction-history-sales-and-contributions)— maybe the donation was made under a different name.

		<field name="content">## What is the widget?

The Artful.ly widget enables you to take donations and sell tickets directly from your own website; making a sleek shopping cart appear on your web page when someone clicks “Buy” or “Donate.”

The clean widget layout works with most web designs, which means ticket buyers don’t have to get directed off your site or bothered by ugly pop-ups. Meanwhile, your patrons' financial information is securely collected and transactions quickly processed.

Depending on what kits you have activated, you can create widgets for ticketing, donations, or both.

Note: The widget is designed to work on computers and not mobile devices. If a patron tries to purchase tickets through the widget using a phone or tablet, the patron will be redirected to complete the purchase in your organization's Artful.ly storefront. There is also a link in the widget to go to your Artful.ly storefront in case the patron has issues during checkout.

**Note: If you are have a WordPress hosted website, install the [Artful.ly WordPress Plugin](/site/knowledgebase/installing-using-the-wordpress-plugin) instead of the Widget.**

## Is the Widget easy to install?

**To install any Artful.ly widget, you must have a firm understanding of your site's markup language**. If you don't know HTML from a hat tree, we suggest you call your friendly website developer or use the automatically generated Artful.ly Storefronts to start selling tickets now.

## Current Version = 3.0

The current version of the widget is 3.0. If you are not running this version please remove your old widget code, generate code for a new widget, and re-install according to the instructions below.

## Installing a Widget

1.  Generate the code for your custom widget by going to the top menu: Sell &gt; Widgets. Or, from your Event Details menu: Share &amp; Sell &gt; On Your Site.
2.  Choose whether to sell tickets, take donations, or both.
3.  If you are selling tickets, choose the event you want to sell tickets to.
4.  You will need jQuery on your site for any widget to work. If you don't already have jQuery installed, select &quot;No, or don't know&quot; and we'll add the jQuery install code to the widget code we give you.
5.  Click **Generate Widget.**
6.  Open the HTML editor for your website.
7.  Copy paste all the code in the top gray box into the &lt;head&gt; tag of your website.
8.  Copy paste all the code in the bottom gray box into the body of your page wherever you want the ticket selector or donation field to appear.
9.  Save your webpage and test the widget.

 ![widget code generator](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=323 &quot;widget code generator&quot;)

## What Your Patron Sees

Once your a patron has completed an order, the confirmation will appear on your website in the widget. They'll also be reminded to check their emails for their receipt.

 ![confirmation after checkout](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=324 &quot;confirmation after checkout&quot;)

**Can I customize the widget on my site?**

**Where the widget appears on the page can be customized, as well as the font and style (CSS) of the widget button.** However the actual shopping cart that appears is not. Whatever content appears on your webpage besides the widget is up to you.

## Got any examples?

Sure thing!

**Real Live Widgets**

These are some links to users' sites with the widget installed. Try selecting a ticket or making a donation. These are live sites, so don't enter your credit card info unless you really intend to charge your card!

		<field name="content">## What's a WordPress Plugin?
Plugins are little bits of code that you can insert into websites built with WordPress CMS. They can do all sorts of things to extend the functionality of your site. Our Artful.ly plugin allows you to sell tickets and/or take donations on your WordPress site. It does the same thing our widgets do but is specially designed to work on WordPress sites.

## **Where This Plugin Will and Won't Work**
**Our plugin works on websites that use WordPress as a content management system but are hosted through a paid host. If your site is hosted on wordpress.com you cannot use this plugin.** The WordPress.com commercial hosting service does not allow users to install JavaScript so our plugin and widget cannot be used on theses sites. Link to the [Artful.ly Storefront](/site/knowledgebase/sell-tickets-via-central-storefront-and-event-storefront) from your site instead. 

Confused? Read more...

Basically, there are two WordPress products:

1.  WordPress CMS, a content management system
2.  WordPress.com, a blog host

WordPress CMS is web software that allows you to create a website and manage the content on it.  To use WordPress, you need to first find a webhost such as Bluehost, DreamHost, or Laughing Squid. That's where your website lives. Then you install WordPress on your hosted site and start designing it and filling it with content. This is when you can install an Artful.ly plugin. Learn more about WordPress CMS at [www.wordpress.org](http://www.wordpress.org/). 

If you do not need the flexibility of a full web host, WordPress offers free blogs on WordPress.com. Blogs hosted on WordPress.com do not support plugins of any kind so you cannot install Artful.ly ticketing or donation tools on those sites. WordPress.com hosted blogs usually have URL that includes &quot;wordpress.com&quot;. Learn more about WordPress hosted blogs at [www.wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com/).

Because WordPress.com hosted blogs are limited, most organizations pay for site hosting and just use the CMS. This allows for great flexibility in design, custom URLs, and access to features like plugins. If you're reading this, I suspect your organization is planning to do this, too, and you should have no problems using the Artful.ly plugins.

## Installing the Plugin
1.  Login to your WordPress site as an administrator.
2.  On the left-hand dashboard menu, click &quot;Plugins.&quot;
3.  Click &quot;Add New.&quot;
4.  In the search box, search for &quot;Artful.ly.&quot;
5.  Under &quot;Artful.ly Widget&quot; click &quot;Install Now.”
6.  After WordPress tells you the plugin was successfully installed, click &quot;Activate Plugin.&quot;

## Current Version = 1.1
The current WordPress plugin version is 1.1. If you are not running this version, please upgrade now (see directions below).

## Using the Plugin to Sell Tickets
1.  Log into your Artful.ly account.
2.  Make sure you have activated the **[Paid Ticketing Kit](/site/knowledgebase/video-getting-started-account-set-up).**
3.  Create an event and publish tickets for that event.
4.  Select **Share &amp; Sell **from the side menu on your event, then choose** WordPress Plugin**.
5.  Copy the **Event ID** number on this page. (You can also find your event ID number at the end of the URL on your event set up pages it looks like this &quot;https://www.artful.ly/events/60&quot;. The number 60 is ID number for that event.).
6.  In WordPress, on the page where you want ticket information to be displayed, insert **[art-event id=&quot;eventID&quot;]** and replace “eventID” with the ID number you copied from Artful.ly.

 ![get the shortcode from the share and sell menu on your event](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=325 &quot;shortcode&quot;)

## Using the Plugin to Take Donations

1.  Log into your Artful.ly account .
2.  Activate a donation kit. If you are a 501(c)(3), add the **501(c)(3) Donation Kit**. If you are fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas, **[connect to Fractured Atlas](/site/knowledgebase/connect-your-sponsored-project-and-artful-ly-account)** to activate your Sponsored Donation Kit.
3.  On your Artful.ly Account Administration page, copy your **Organization ID** number. You'll also see this ID number listed on the **Wordpress Plugin** page in the **Share &amp; Sell** menu for each Event.
4.  In WordPress, on the page where you the want the donation field to be displayed, insert **[art-donation id=&quot;organizationID&quot;]** and replace “organizationID” with the number you copied.

![account administration](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=326 &quot;account administration&quot;)

## Updating Your Plugin (Version 1.1)
We make improvements to the WP plugin as needed. If you have having problems with a plugin, please make sure you are running the latest version which is 1.1 (as of October 2015). To update your plugin:

1.  Login to your WordPress admin dashboard.
2.  Go to &quot;Plugins.&quot;
3.  Below the Artful.ly plugin, there should be an alert that says version 1.1 is available, click the &quot;Upgrade&quot; link there. 
4.  If you don't see an alert for the Artful.ly plugin, navigate to another page of your admin panel then go back to the Plugin page--that should force the alert to appear. Proceed with the upgrade. 
5.  After you upgrade the plugin to version 1.1, it will take WordPress approximately 10 minutes to clear it's cache and then anywhere you have Artful.ly short codes displayed should update accordingly.

		<field name="content">*A little preemptive warning:* We aren't WordPress developers or designers. That's a different brand of geekdom. We have picked up a few tips that we'll share, but if you need helping building a site you need to hire someone who specializes in WordPress.

## First: Update Your Artful.ly Plugin!
1.  For best performance, make sure you are running the latest version of the Artful.ly plugin.
2.  Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.
3.  Select &quot;Plugins&quot; from the side menu.
4.  Find &quot;Artful.ly Widget.&quot;
5.  If there is an update notice below that, click &quot;update now.&quot;
6.  This will update all the Artful.ly elements on your site, no need to update or change the individual short codes you've placed on your pages.

## Editing Plugin Appearance
The Artful.ly plugin doesn't come with any set styles—it just picks up the style from the theme you have chosen for your WordPress site. To edit the appearance of Artful.ly plugin elements like the ticket headers, ticket selector, or donation field, you need to edit your WordPress theme.

Editing a WordPress theme is best left to an experienced WordPress designer. But, if you're the brave type and want to teach yourself, [check out these instructions from WordPress](http://en.support.wordpress.com/custom-design/editing-css/).

## How do I change the font size of the event name?
1.  Select &quot;Appearance&quot; from the side menu.
2.  Select &quot;Editor.&quot;
3.  Scroll to the bottom of all the style code.
4.  Insert this snippet **#artfully-event h1 {font-size: 24px;}**
5.  Change the number of the font size to whatever size you need—14px, 20px, 32px, etc.
6.  Click &quot;Update File.&quot;
7.  Check the page where you have a short code for an event installed—the font size of the event name should reflect your styling changes.

## How do I make the bullets go away?
Many WordPress themes insert bullets by the show dates like this...

![bullets.png](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=328 &quot;bullets&quot;)

Often, you can make these bullets go away by making a little change to the theme's style sheet. Crack open the CSS editor, then add this code snippet:

`li.performance { background: none; }`

If that doesn't work you can try adding this to your custom CSS section or the main CSS file for your theme. 
`ul.performances &gt; li { list-style: none !important; }`

`ul.ticket-types &gt; li {list-style: none !important; }`


That should clear it up.

		<field name="content">To install any Artful.ly widget, **you must have a firm understanding of your site's markup language and the ability to add HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. If you don't know HTML from a hat tree, we suggest you call your friendly website developer or use the automatically generated Artful.ly Storefronts to start selling tickets now.  

Because the widget is code that you install on your site, sometimes adding this new element unearths other latent errors in the site's code. Unfortunately, we cannot help you debug other developers' programming, so it's best if you work with someone who knows and can access your whole site.

## Troubleshooting Tips:
*   **For donation widgets, do you have a donation kit activated?** You, or your organization administrator, can see what kits you have turned by clicking on your email users name, then selecting &quot;Account Administration&quot; from the dropdown. You need to either have the 501(c)(3) Donations Kit activated, or have connected your Artful.ly account to an active Fractured Atlas Fiscally Sponsored project. Connecting a project will automatically turn on the Sponsored Donation Kit.  

*   **For ticket widgets, do you have the Paid Event Ticketing Kit activated?** You, or your organization administrator, can see what kits you have turned by clicking on your email users name, then selecting &quot;Account Administration&quot; from the dropdown. The Paid Event Ticketing Kit will have a check next to it if it is activated.  

*   **For ticket widgets, make sure you have a PUBLISHED show.** Your ticketing widget may be properly installed, but if you don't have a show created and published for that event patrons will not be able to select tickets in the widget.
*   **Got a self-hosted WordPress site?** Use our WordPress plugin instead of the regular widget. It's faster, smoother, and easier to install. [Learn how here.](/site/knowledgebase/installing-using-the-wordpress-plugin)
*   **Got a WordPress.com site?** This commercial hosting service does not allow users to install JavaScript  so widgets won't work. These sites also do not support plugins so the WordPress plugin won't work either. Use an Artful.ly Storefront to sell tickets instead or upgrade to a paid WordPress site to allow for plugin functionality.
*   **Check different browsers.** Are you seeing the same problem in Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer? If the error is limited to one browser, you may have found a bug. Let us know via support@artful.ly.
*   **Is your browser up to date?** The most current version of an Internet browser will give you the best idea of your site's operation. Read about how to check what version your browser is and if it's up-to-date [here](http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/how-do-i/check-browser-version.php).
*   **Did you paste in both the header script and the div script?** The widget is comprised of two chunks of code. You need to install the JavaScript bit in header of your page AND the display code where you want the actual ticket selector or donation field to appear.
*   **Is jQuery installed multiple times?** jQuery is needed to run the widget but if it is installed more than once on your site, it may cause a conflict.
*   **Check for code errors.** We like to open the problem page in a Chrome browser to look for errors. Do that, then right click on the page. Select 'Inspect element.' On the toolbar, select 'Console.' If there is an error with the page code, it will be indicated there. If the error includes the word &quot;Artful.ly,&quot; please let us know. If the error mentions some other bit of code, your website developer can help you figure out what needs to be done to resolve the issue.
*   **Are you running the latest version of the widget code? **We are currently on version 3 of the widget. To see what version of the widget code you are running, look in the head tag for the phrase &quot;artfully-v3&quot;.   

    Here's an example of **old widget code**. It just says &quot;artfully.js&quot;

![old widget code](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=329 &quot;old widget code&quot;)

Here's an example of **current widget code**. It says &quot;artfully-v3.js&quot;

![current widget code](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=330 &quot;current widget code&quot;)

**Still not working?**

*   Use your Event Storefront to sell tickets
*   For 501(c)(3)s, use your Donation Storefront to take donations.
*   For Fractured Atlas Fiscally Sponsored projects, use your project page to take donations.

1.  Make a purchase with your credit card.
2.  Wait 24 hours, then [refund](/site/knowledgebase/refund-exchange-return-tickets) the transaction (the card needs to be processed fully before a refund can be issued).

**You can only refund a transaction through Artful.ly before the money is settled.** After that, you'd have to cut yourself a check, which is a lot of hassle for a little testing! To test donations, you may as well give yourself a $.01 gift so that you don't have to worry about charging your card any real amount of money.

**Donations** are settled two business days from when the donation is made.

**Ticket sales** for each show, are settled two business days after that show or performance of an event. 

## Demo Widgets:
If you'd like to see how the widget works before you install it for real on your own website, we have installed Artful.ly widgets on these fake sites for you to explore. These two pages use the same event and same widget JavaScript and CSS from Artful.ly but the web site designer has styled them very differently so you can see the possibilities.

You can go through the whole checkout process in these widgets by using this dummy credit card number: 4111111111111111. Name, billing address, valid expiration date, and csv code can be whatever you want.

## Define &quot;Passes&quot;
Passes are for selling a set of tickets to multiple events and shows. This is useful for events like festivals, season passes, concert or lecture series, or two-part shows. When a customer buys a pass, the patron receives a pass code that functions similar to a discount code for an event.

To apply the pass to tickets, the patron enters the code during checkout and the eligible tickets become $0. 

![pass code entry](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=331 &quot;pass code entry&quot;)

## Kit Activation
The Passes Kit is currently only available to beta testers. If you would like to beta test these features please have your Organization Administrator email us at support@artful.ly and we will set up a time to go over the kit with you.

		<field name="content">Creating Passes is a two-step process. First you create the pass, and then you select which shows are eligible.

## Add a New Pass
1.  In the top menu bar click **Sell **and **Passes.**  

 ![sell menu passes](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=332 &quot;sell passes&quot;)  

2.  On your Passes overview page select **Add New Pass**. This will take you to the page where you add all of your pass details.  

    ![add new pass type](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=333 &quot;add new pass type&quot;)

## Basics
1.  **Name**: The first thing you'll do is give your pass a name. This can be as simple as &quot;Season Pass&quot; or it can be unique to your organization.
2.  **Description**: Here is where you'll tell potential passholders exactly what the pass entitles them to.
3.  **Pass Start and End Date**: Next you'll define the date range for which the pass is valid. A passholder will be able to use his/her pass for shows within this time frame.  

    ![pass basics](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=334 &quot;pass basics&quot;)

## Pricing
1.  **Number of Tickets**: How many tickets is the pass valid for? If you are running a show with multiple events, it's a good best practice to make this number equal to your number of events.
2.  **Price**: How much the pass costs.
3.  **Who Pays The Fee? **You have the option to pass the service fee on to the patron or roll it into the pass price.  In both cases you, the producer, will pay the credit card processing fee. For more information, check out our article on [Pass Fees](/site/knowledgebase/beta-pass-fees-and-settlements)
    ![passes pricing options](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=335 &quot;passes pricing options&quot;)

## Storefront Copy
The messages a patron sees after purchasing a pass are customizable:

1.  **Thanks Message**: This field lets you add custom text to the **Order** **Confirmation Thanks** page that appears after a customer purchases a pass.
2.  **Email Message**:This field adds custom text to the **Pass Details Email**.

![pass storefront copy](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=336 &quot;pass storefront copy&quot;)

## Sales 
1.  Sales Start and End
2.  Show on Storefront: Checking this box makes the pass visible in your Passes Storefront; it's akin to publishing or unpublishing a show from the storefront.
3.  Finally you'll click **Save** to finalize the pass so you can select which events and shows the pass applies to.

		<field name="content">In order for patrons to use their pass on an event, the event must be made eligible for passes to be used. As the producer, you define how the pass may be used.

## Adding Pass Eligibility
1.  Open an **Event** you would like to make eligible for passholders.
2.  Select **Share &amp;Sell** and **Passes**. This will prompt you to add a pass to this event.  

    ![share and sell passes](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=338 &quot;share and sell passes&quot;)  

3.  Select a **Pass Type** you want to apply to the event.  

4.  Decide whether or not the pass is active immediately or not. If the box is left unchecked, you'll have to navigate back and check the box when you would like patrons to use pass codes for that event.  

5.  **Ticket Limit per Pass**: This is the number of tickets the pass may be used for in one transaction. In most cases, you'll probably want this to be one, but you can change the limit based on your pass business rules.   

6.  **Allowed Ticket Types**: This menu lets you select which ticket types the pass is eligible for. For example, if you have a more expensive VIP ticket type and a VIP Pass, you could make the VIP Pass eligible for the VIP ticket type.   

7.  **Excluded Shows**: You also have the option to exclude individual shows for the event in case you have special performances that you do not want to allow passes for.  

8.  Finally, **Save** the changes.  

    ![add a pass details](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=339 &quot;add a pass details&quot;)

## Adding Multiple Passes to an Event

To add additional passes to an event:

1.  Navigate back to **Share &amp; Sell** and **Passes**.
2.  Click the **Add** button.

2.  Upon checkout, the patron receives an email with their pass code, and a link to start using the pass right away.

1.  Navigate to that member's People Record and click either the **Membership ID, Member Tag,** or the **Work With** button. Each will take you to the Member History page.

    ![Member History Pathways](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=350 &quot;Member History Pathways&quot;) 

2.  On the Member History page, click on the red **Reset Password** button. An email with a temporary password will be sent to the person. Keep in mind the temporary password will eventually expire, so it's best to send one when you have a member on the phone with you, or when you know they will be checking their email soon. Sending a follow up email after sending a temporary password is also a good idea.

## Resetting Member Passwords When Emails are Incorrect

When resetting your member's password, it's a good idea to check to see if the member's email address is spelled correctly. Sometimes patrons make a typo when purchasing their memberships, which sets the member login to the misspelled email address. When this happens, if you try to reset the member's password, she'll never get the email. 

Luckily there's an easy fix:

1.  Open the Member's record. Click **Work With** and **Edit Info**.  

    ![Member Record Work With](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=349 &quot;Member Record Work With&quot;)
2.  Correct the email address and click OK.
3.  Click **Work With **again, select **View Memberships** and click the red Password Reset Button.
4.  Click the **Reset Password** button and make sure the email address that appears in the blue bubble at the top of the page is spelled correctly.

With this option the patron sees a nice round amount, but your revenue is lower. Of course, you can also choose this option and increase the price of the pass to cover the fee.

| Producer Receives | $50-5% service fee= 47.45 -3.5% credit card fee= **$45.79**     | $50-3.5% credit card fee= **$48.25**| 

## Passes Settlements
Settlements for pass revenue initiate two days after a pass is purchased.

## Passes Refunds
Refunds can be processed within Artful.ly during the two day period before the funds are settled. Once the settlement is has been deposited into your bank account, any refunds are at your discretion and must be sent outside the Artful.ly system eg. via check.

		<field name="title">Beta: Pass Usage Report</field>
		<field name="content">It's possible to see the pass usage for individual patrons in their pass histories, but sometimes you'll want a higher-level view of the pass usage for your whole patron base. We call it the Pass Usage report. To find it, navigate to **Reports** in the top menu bar and select **Pass Usage.** A copy of your pass report can also be downloaded as a CSV.

![pass usage](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=379 &quot;pass usage&quot;)

On this page you can search by pass type and order date range to find when tickets are being claimed through your passes. In the report, you'll find an at-a-glance view of:

*   The number of passes sold
*   The number of tickets sold from passes
*   How many tickets remain on those passes

Using the drop down menu, you can find information on a specific type of pass, and/or a specific date range. 

**Within each row you'll be able to find**: 

*   Which pass type was used
*   Order number and date
*   Passholder name
*   Event name
*   Number of tickets in the order
*   Original ticket price
*   Gross sales

![individual pass usage](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=380 &quot;individual pass usage&quot;)

In the bottom portion of the report, you'll find more information about the individual orders where passes were used. Usually you'll be looking at the usage report for multiple patrons, but for the above example, it's easiest if we look at one usage for one patron's orders. In the example, we can see Leslie has purchased one pass valid for six tickets. She has used the pass to purchase four tickets over two orders, and there are now two tickets left on her pass.

		<field name="title">Beta: Printing Membership Cards</field>
		<field name="content">Once you have sold some memberships, you may want to print membership cards to distribute to your members. Here's how:

1.  From top menu, select **Orders**, then**Memberships.**

    ![Membership Orders Menu](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=354 &quot;Membership Orders Menu&quot;)  

2.  Choose a date range of membership orders.  

     ![Membership Orders Date Range](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=353 &quot;Membership Orders Date Range&quot;)

3.  Choose a membership type or all types and click **Search**.  

    ![Select Membership Type From Menu](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=355 &quot;Select Membership Type From Menu&quot;)  

4.  Click **Work With** and select **Print Member Cards_;_** this will generate a PDF.  

    ![Work With Menu to Print Member Cards](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=352 &quot;Work With Menu to Print Member Cards&quot;)

**We suggest performing a small test print to make sure your printer aligns the PDF with the card perforations**. In our tests, it seemed to work best when we did not use the &quot;scale to fit&quot; setting on the printer.

Membership cards are formatted to print 3.375 x 2.125&quot;. This is the size of a standard credit card. We've formatted bulk card printing to work with [Blanks USA Synthetic Cards](http://www.blanksusa.com/products/integrated-cards/synthetic-cards &quot;Blanks USA Synthetic Cards&quot;) which available in packs of 60, 300, or 600, and are also available from Staples and other office supply stores. These synthetic cards are durable, tear-resistant, and compatible with laser and ink jet printers. 

You can print one side with your company logo or design using templates available on Blank USA's website, then print the reverse side with the member information and QR code generated by Artful.ly.

As an alternative, you can print on standard card stock and then cut the cards afterward.</field>

		<field name="content">## Membership Cards

When patrons buy a membership, they are also sent a membership card as an email attachment.

If a member brings a membership card to a show, the card may be scanned by the [Artful.ly iOS app](/site/knowledgebase/the-artful-ly-app-scan-tickets-with-your-iphone-or-ipod-touch). When the card is scanned one of three things will happen:

1.  If the member has purchased a ticket to the show, the app can scan the membership card and check in the patron.&lt;/span&gt;
2.  If the member has not purchased a ticket to the show, but member ticket types are **$0 tickets**, then the app will sell the member a free ticket and check in the patron.
3.  If the patron does not have a ticket, but presents the card to an event where tickets are paid, then the app will give an error message.

Organizations that use member cards may want to add language referencing the card in the email customization fields when setting up a membership type.

Selling a membership through Artful.ly has a 5% service fee plus a 3.5% credit card processing fee. These fees apply whether the patron purchases the tickets through your Member Storefront or the Sales Console. There are no fees for memberships paid via cash, check, or comp.

As a producer, you have the option to have the patron pay the service fee on top of the membership price, or you can pay the service fee out of your sales revenue.

Let's consider an example with a $50 membership:

## Membership Settlements

Settlements for membership revenue initiate two days after a membership is purchased.

## Membership Refunds

Refunds can be processed within Artful.ly during the two day period before the funds are settled. Once the settlement is issued, any refunds are at your discretion and need to be send outside the Artful.ly system eg. via check.

## Fees on Member Tickets

The $2 service fee applies to paid member ticket types. If the member ticket is $0, there is no additional service fee.

		<field name="content">It's possible to import your historical membership history. The import process is similar to bringing in your ticket or donation history. 

1.  Go to **Reports** in the top menu bar and select **Imports/Exports**.
2.  Select **Import Memberships**.  

    ![Import Memberships Button](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=382 &quot;Import Memberships Button&quot;)

3.  Download the Artful.ly membership import template CSV.  

    ![Download CSV Template Link](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=384 &quot;Download CSV Template&quot;)

## Building Your CSV

As you begin to copy your content into the CSV template, keep in mind that email addresses are required for every membership you import or sell. Because an email address is required, the following fields are optional, but highly encouraged:

*   First names
*   Last names
*   Company names

The rest of the required columns correspond to the fields required to create a membership type to sell in your storefront:

*   **Membership Name -** However you refer to your membership.This is unique to each membership type you create.  

*   **Membership Type -** This will be either **Seasonal** or **Rolling**. Seasonal memberships have a fixed start and end date, and membership drives typically happen over a specific portion of the year. Rolling memberships are valid for a certain amount of months or years beginning from when the membership is purchased.   

*   **Start Date** - Required for both seasonal and rolling memberships. The date the membership begins for patrons. Dates must be in one of the following formats: if you're using Excel, the format should be **DD-MMM-YY HH:MMpm**. If you're editing the file in another program, it's a good rule-of-thumb to format the date as **YYYY/MM/DD HH:MMpm**. Specific order times are optional.  

*   **End Date -** Only for seasonal memberships.The date the membership ends.  

*   **Duration** - Rolling Memberships only. This will be a number that corresponds to what you define in the period column. For example, if you have a 6 month membership you would put &quot;6&quot; in the duration column, and &quot;months&quot; in the period column.  

*   **Period** - Rolling Memberships only. This is how you measure how long a rolling membership is—either in **months** or **years**.  

*   **Price Paid** - How much does your membership cost? Make sure you just put dollars and cents with no &quot;$&quot; or other symbols.  

*   **Payment Method **- You can enter Cash, Credit Card, Check, Comp, Other, or Unknown.

## Other Optional Fields

*   **Order Date - **This is optional. The order date must be in one of the following formats. If you're using Excel, format your dates as **DD-MMM-YY HH:MMpm.** If you're editing the file in another program, it's a good rule-of-thumb to format the date as  **YYYY/MM/DD HH:MMpm**. The time of the order is optional.  

*   ****Every Other Field -**** Any other column header that works on people imports can be done with a membership import, like Twitter handles, tags, and birthdays.

##  Uploading Your CSV

1.  Once you have your CSV filled out with all of the content double-checked, select **Choose File** and **Import **to begin the process.  

    ![Upload Import File](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=386 &quot;Upload Import File&quot;)
2.  Once you upload the file, you'll be taken to a page to review the membership types you're importing. New membership types will be in the box in the upper portion of the page, and if you're importing memberships to an existing membership type, those will appear below the new membership types.   

    ![Membership Import Data Review](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=383 &quot;Membership Import Data Review&quot;)
3.  To approve the membership import, you'll first need to preview the data for any existing or previous memberships you have. Once you've previewed the content and double-checked to make sure it's correct, you'll then be able to approve the import as the last step.

** Note: Membership imports cannot be recalled once you have approved them.**

*   **Starts**: Searches for memberships that begin within a specific date range.
*   **Ends**: Searches for memberships ending within a specific date range.
*   **Status**: Finds members who are Current, Lapsed, Past, or Non-Members.
 ![The membership status search condition in Advanced Search](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=776 &quot;membership status search&quot;)

  *   Current members have valid memberships as of the date of the search.
  *   Lapsed members are members whose memberships have expired within the past year.
  *   Past members have not had a valid membership in the past year but they had one more than a year ago.
  *   Non-Members are people who have never been members of your organization.

*   **Type**: Finds people with a specific membership type.
  ![Advanced Search for Membership Criteria](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=777 &quot;Membership Advanced Search&quot;)

## Searching for Membership Types

Membership type is an available condition in Advanced Search. You can search for all membership types or for specific ones.
 ![Membership Type Search](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=777 &quot;Membership Type Search&quot;)

## Membership Sales Stats

In the **Sell** menu under **Memberships**  you can see an at-a-glance view of how many of each membership type you have sold. Typically, the number of Memberships Sold will equal the number of members, unless members are allowed to purchase more than one membership per person.

 ![Membership Sales Stats](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=388 &quot;Membership Sales Stats&quot;)

## Membership Sales by Order

Under **Orders**, and **Membership **you'll find a list of membership sales. Here you can search by the date of sale as well as the membership type. You can also export your membership orders reports as CSVs.

		<field name="content">In certain situations, our projects may not be able to apply for a grant. Below are some of the reasons why a project would not be allowed to apply for a grant with Fractured Atlas as their fiscal sponsor:

- A particular funder does not accept fiscally sponsored applications (like the National Endowment for the Arts)
- Fractured Atlas may be applying to a particular funder for our own programming (although it is rare that our applications conflict with our projects' since we operate very different programs)
- A funder may only accept one application per organization and your application would prevent other projects from applying (we usually don't allow our projects to apply to sources that restrict the number of applications)
- A foundation is simply out of the realistic scope of an emerging artist/organization and it would be inappropriate for Fractured Atlas to allow that application to be submitted
- A project has not met the [Fractured Atlas grant eligibility requirement](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/grant-eligibility-requirement)
- A project does not meet the required guidelines that a funder publishes 

In all cases, we strive to be as helpful and as accommodating as possible regarding grant applications and we aim to work with projects to apply to as many funding sources as possible.

		<field name="content">All grant proposals and LOIs **must be reviewed by a Fractured Atlas staff member prior to submission** to the funder. Before we can issue any materials, we’ll first need to review and approve your application materials. **We require 10 business days to review all grant materials.**

Once you have identified an appropriate source, you should email the following documents and information to begin the application process on our end:

- The application deadline, full contact information for the funding source, and link to the funding source website (if available)
- Any and all application forms &amp; cover letters (or the LOI)
- The completed narrative sections &amp; projected budgets
- A list of any and all required supplemental documents (Board of Directors, Audited Financials, etc.)
- Your “ask” amount along with the funding source’s average or typical grant amount

We need to keep this information on file since we are legally the applicant of record and must be available to answer any questions if contacted by the funder about your proposal.

Once we have reviewed everything and you have made any necessary changes, we will send the documents required from Fractured Atlas in order to complete the application as a PDF. These materials could include any or all of the following:

- Endorsement letter – this certifies that you are fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas and provides our contact information in case the funder needs to get in touch with our staff for any reason.
- IRS Letter of Determination – this is what certifies Fractured Atlas as a tax exempt, charitable organization and is typically required for grant applications.
- Audited Financial Statement
- Form 990
- Board of Directors
- Organization Budget

Getting an EIN is not enough to open a business bank account as was once the case. Before you get one, we suggest you contact an attorney or an accountant.

		<field name="content">A Fractured Atlas staff member can authorize use of Fractured Atlas’s EIN on a case by case basis. These instances include, but are not limited to:

- Applying for a grant
- Soliciting non-cash donations 
- Soliciting monetary donations

**What if my situation does not fall into one of the above categories?**

Please contact us if your individual situation does not fall into one of the above categories. We’ll work with you to figure out whether or not it is appropriate to use our EIN for your specific situation.

**How do I obtain permission to use your EIN?**

Please contact us to seek permission to use our EIN. Remember, our EIN is kind of like our Social Security Number, so we’ll need to know:

- Who is asking for it? What is his/her/the business’s address?
- Why is it needed/how will it be used?
- Is there an application involved?
- Is there a contract involved?
- When is it needed?

We’ll issue a letter containing our EIN unless there is a different format required. This business-style letter will be emailed to you as a PDF which you can then pass along to the person/entity requesting it. 

**How long will it take for you to send Fractured Atlas’s EIN?**

It really depends on the situation. It could take us 1 business day if it is for a simple donation that does not require an application or anything else, or it could take us 10 business days if it is for a grant in which case we’ll need to review and approve the grant application. In all cases, please let us know when you need the EIN and we’ll try to email it to you by that date. Please do leave a few days for back and forth in case any questions arise about your situation.  

**Note:** The Fractured Atlas staff reserves the right to deny permission for use of Fractured Atlas’s EIN. Using Fractured Atlas’s EIN in any situation without written permission for that situation is a prohibited activity of our program and is grounds for termination of your fiscal sponsorship.

		<field name="content">An application for fiscal sponsorship will be denied if it does not fall within one of our three major criteria for approval. Specifically, the project will be denied if its artistic component is not clearly defined, if it does not provide a public benefit, or it seems to be commercial in nature or for personal gain. Our staff will be in touch before the applications go to our board if we have any concerns regarding your application. If you fail to address these concerns in the time allowed, your application may be denied, but we will usually offer the chance to apply again the following month.

		<field name="content">Our fiscal sponsorship program is structured as a grantor-grantee relationship. This means that all funds that are released from Fractured Atlas for the purposes of the project are considered a grant. The grantor is Fractured Atlas and the grantee is the legal entity of the project. The IRS requires that a grantee reports all grant income on their taxes. This means that all funds released through our fiscal sponsorship program are considered taxable income according to the IRS. The legal entity is the individual or business entity responsible for reporting the income we disburse to the IRS. </field>

		<field name="title">What if the grant application is online?</field>
		<field name="content">**The bad news:** Online applications often create problems for sponsored applicants for two reasons: there is no way to distinguish the project from the sponsor and many systems only allow one application per organization. Since Fractured Atlas’s program aims to be as inclusive as possible, we cannot allow one project to apply at the expense of the other artists we serve.

**The good news:** There are a few funders who have built their online applications to accept multiple applications for sponsored projects under the primary account for the sponsoring organization. In cases like this, you are certainly allowed to apply using Fractured Atlas as your fiscal sponsor.

Many online applications (especially for corporate funders) require a tax ID in order to access the application. This means that Fractured Atlas staff must set up the account for you. In some cases, we may have to complete the application for you, and will send you your portion of the application to complete. Most of these applications can be handled within the one hour time allotment, but please note that there may be fees for applications that take more than one hour of cumulative staff time.

You can apply for sponsorship for your work, or &quot;project,&quot; and if approved by our Board of Directors, you will be able to solicit tax-deductible donations from individuals, corporate sponsors, and grantmakers, all of which would be otherwise available only to nonprofits.

It is the responsibility of each fiscally sponsored project to raise its own money. We do, however, provide educational resources to our projects to aid them in their fundraising efforts. We offer fundraising templates to use in outreach efforts, and our staff is always available to answer your questions. Our fiscal sponsorship team also presents webinars covering topics related to fundraising and we offer a free one-hour consultation on fundraising to our projects each year.

For active fiscally sponsored projects, you can access our fundraising templates on your My Fiscal Sponsorship page on our site.

		<field name="content">If you want to become fiscally sponsored for a brand new project, we can “expire” your original fiscal sponsorship which would allow you to submit an application for the new project on our website. If you’re seeking to become fiscally sponsored for expanded or edited activities related to your original project, we’ll have you submit an “expansion” application to be reviewed by our Board of Directors. 

In order to do this, our fiscal sponsorship staff will need to set your current fiscal sponsorship status to “pending,” which will allow you access to your original application where you can make the necessary edits or additions. While your fiscal sponsorship is pending, you will not be able to release funds and we will not be able to process donations for the purposes of your fiscal sponsorship. Please [contact us](/site/helpdesk) in order to start this process.

From there, you'll need to complete our [EFT Sign Up Form](/site/fiscal/EFT_Sign_Up.pdf) and you'll need to send us a voided check. Your bank account must be in the United States in order to receive electronic fund transfers from Fractured Atlas.

*Please also note that we cannot accept temporary or starter checks* and that the check must include your account and routing numbers as well as confirmation of the account holder name and address.

![Image showcasing starter checks with the &quot;no&quot; symbol](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=585 &quot;No Starter Checks&quot;)

If you do not have a check to void, we'll require a bank-issued document complete with contact information instead. A copy of a checking statement with address and account number should suffice. We can accept a letter from the bank with the account number, routing number, account holder name, and address as well.

After you've sent your EFT information to Fractured Atlas and received confirmation from us that it's been set up, you can request funds from the [fund release request form.](/site/fiscal/fund_release) Request and releases can be made seven (7) days after the donations are received. Electronic fund releases take one (1) to three (3) business days to show up in your bank account once approved by Fractured Atlas.

		<field name="title">Grant Eligibility Requirement</field>
		<field name="content">You must first raise $1,000 for your project from individual sources other than yourself and immediate family before you’ll be eligible to submit a letter of inquiry or a proposal to a funder. Earned revenue does not count towards this requirement. 

We implemented this policy to protect the integrity of the fiscal sponsorship program and to maximize your chances of being funded when you do submit grant applications. It may seem unpleasant, but this rule exists for a couple of important reasons:

- Best practices dictate that you should wait to approach institutional funders until after you’ve established a base of individual support.
- Funders have consistently told us that they don’t want to receive grant applications from projects that have no committed base of support for the activity.

Ultimately, by meeting the $1,000 eligibility requirement, you are improving your chances of being funded. Having committed funds on your project budget shows that you are experienced with handling funds, and that your project is already on its way to being successfully funded.

**What if I raised funds before I was fiscally sponsored?**

If you can provide proof that you have been awarded a grant or received donations within the last two years for the same project, you may be exempt from this requirement. Examples of proof include:

- Award letters from the funder
- Donation award letters from your donors
- Links to a previous crowdfunding campaign

- Rush fee: if you need a response in fewer than 10 business days, we must charge a $75 rush fee. Paying the rush fee guarantees a response within 1 business day.
- Grant administration fee: We allocate each LOI and grant application with one hour of staff time to review it and provide what is needed for final submission. If more than one hour of a Fractured Atlas staff member’s time is required to help you submit a grant or administer the award and reports, we will need to charge you for the time required at a rate of $50/hr. You will be notified of this before we do anything in cases where it is applicable.

**Note:** Fractured Atlas reserves the right to deny the submission of LOIs or grant applications at any time. To protect the integrity of the program and to ensure that funders have a positive experience with Fractured Atlas projects, we try only to submit sponsored proposals that are appropriate and well presented.

		<field name="content">An authorized user is a person who’s name is listed on a membership. For Community and Professional level memberships, there can only be one person listed. For Organization level membership, you can have up to three authorized users listed on the account. We can only share account-specific information with the authorized user(s) for that account. This is to protect the privacy of our members.

If you have an Organization level membership, there is a Master or “primary” user who is able to add or remove authorized users on the account. The Master user can make these changes by logging into the account at [www.fracturedatlas.org](http://www.fracturedatlas.org) and going to “My Stuff” → “Manage Users”.

If you signed up for membership and are working with another person who is going to the primary administrator of the account (e.g. they are going to be the one calling or emailing Fractured Atlas regarding the account), we ask that you either: 

1) request to have the membership under their name 

**OR** 

2) upgrade to the Organization level of membership and add them as an authorized user.</field>

		<field name="title">What are the fees for fiscal sponsorship?</field>
		<field name="content">Fractured Atlas takes a 7% administrative fee on all donations, with **no additional fees** for processing credit cards. As you raise funds over the lifetime of your project, **the fee is reduced**. 

*These lower fees apply only to grants and donations by check*, but not to donations by credit card:

![enter image description here](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=592 &quot;enter image title here&quot;)

This fee covers all costs associated with administering your fiscal sponsorship - including staff time, website maintenance, and bank fees. The fee also potentially represents a significant discount for smaller arts organizations in that, unless you have automated systems in place and dedicated staff to handle your accounting, the cost of tasks such as maintaining your 501(c)(3) status with the IRS and issuing tax receipts to donors can often eat up more than 7% of any given donation.

An important note about fees: In cases where Fractured Atlas is charged a fee by a vendor that is associated with your fund, we must pass that fee along to you. (An example of this would be a returned check fee.) Our staff will contact you if a situation like this occurs. Also, in certain cases, we may need to charge additional fees related to grants administration - those are explained in the Applying for Grants section of the Knowledge Base.</field>

**An Organizational Membership** is for three people (you can add more to the membership at an additional fee) that are in the same organization. This organization does not need to be an LLC, nor does it need to be any type of established entity. If a group of you want to start a band and call yourselves ABC Rock Stars, then that's your organization, whether officially recognized or not. The members of the organization (beyond the lead member on the account when you sign up) will need to [register as Users](/site/members/prefs/?section=contact) on the account to be able to use our services (you can do so by having the lead member log into the website, click on &quot;Settings,&quot; and then on &quot;Users&quot;). 

**A Community Membership** is a free single-user membership that allows you access to [Artful.ly](https://www.artful.ly/), [SpaceFinder](/site/spacefinder), [FracturedU](/site/prodev/fractured_u), [the calendar of events](/site/events/), and our [special offers](/site/specialoffers/). 

**Please note**, if you are the sole person administering the Fractured Atlas membership and our services for your organization (meaning, no one else will need to log in to the website or contact us), then feel free to sign up for one of the single-user memberships. You only need to sign up for an Organizational Membership if multiple people will need their own login information and/or will need to contact us about the membership/our services.

		<field name="content">If you're a brand-new fiscally sponsored project looking to set-up direct deposit, or if you're an existing fiscally sponsored project trying to change direct deposit to a new checking account, you can download [the sign up form for electronic funds transfer (EFT) here.](/site/fiscal/EFT_Sign_Up.pdf)

When you fill out the form, keep in mind that we will also require supplemental documentation from the bank that confirms the account and routing numbers as well as the account holder name and address. The best way to confirm this info is with a voided check. Please note that we cannot accept temporary or starter checks and that the check must include your account and routing numbers as well as confirmation of the account holder name and address.  

![Sample check showing account, banking, and routing numbers](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=497 &quot;Screen shot of a check and its parts&quot;)

If you don't have checks for your account you may also be able to send us a letter from your bank, direct deposit verification (which you can usually download from your bank's website), or a scan of your most recent account statement (with any personal financial information blacked out).

You can send the completed EFT sign up form and voided check/account documentation via email to support@fracturedatlas.org. You can also fax it to 212-277-8025 or mail it to our address below.

		<field name="title">How do I know if a donation is eligible for a tax receipt?</field>
		<field name="content">Fractured Atlas can accept and process donations made by check, debit/credit card, or noncash (in-kind) donations of physical tangible items contributed to your project.

You're welcome to accept cash donations, but these will need to be paid to you and your project directly and we cannot issue tax receipts for donations made by cash or money order.

Fractured Atlas uses the following IRS guidelines to determine whether or not we can issue a tax receipt.

- **Fully Deductible**: When a donor gives money to a charity and receives nothing in exchange for the gift, that donation is fully tax deductible to the extent permitted by law.  

- **Partially Deductible**: When a donor gives money to a charity and receives goods or services in exchange (i.e. free tickets, a reception, a DVD, a t-shirt), s/he is only entitled to a tax-deduction for the amount donated above the value of the goods and services offered. In these cases, it is generally the recipient organization's responsibility to estimate the value of the items offered.  

- **Sometimes Deductible**: When a donor gives tangible goods, the donation is tax-deductible based on the donor's estimate of the item's value. Office supplies, food, equipment, etc. are included in this category. NOTE: Fractured Atlas cannot accept or process vehicle donations (although a car does qualify as a tangible item).  

- **Never Deductible**: When a donor gives pro-bono services (like fundraising, legal advice or graphic design) the donation is not considered tax-deductible according to the IRS. Free rent is also not considered tax deductible by the IRS, so donations of space are also not considered tax-deductible.

In some cases, the sponsored project will be able to sign the contract instead of or in addition to a Fractured Atlas staff person.

		<field name="content">Do you have ongoing activities? If so, it’ll probably be simplest for you to apply for those ongoing activities. You will only be able to fundraise for the activities approved by our board. This means that if you apply for a one-off project, you will only be able to fundraise for those approved activities. 

If you’d like to fundraise for more than one project, but you’ve only been approved for one, we will require you to submit an edited or expanded application with your new activities to be approved by our board. All of these edited application will fall into the regular review cycle along with the new applications for fiscal sponsorship. This means that it will be reviewed by our board the following month and you’ll be notified of approval by the 15th of that month.

		<field name="content">**Who submits the grant reports? **  

It depends. In many cases, you will work directly with a fiscal sponsorship staff member to submit the report. Regardless of the case, please contact Fractured Atlas staff before submitting the report. At the very least, we’ll need to have a copy of the report on file.   

**Are there any fees related to submitting a grant report? **  

Similar to a grant application, we’ll designate 1 hour at no cost for grant reports. There are rare situations when elaborate or extensive documentation is required (usually when dealing with government funding agencies), and we may need to charge for our time in those cases. In these cases, we’ll charge the same $50/hr rate we charge for grant reviews.

		<field name="content">A Fractured Atlas staff member can authorize use of Fractured Atlas’s IRS determination letter in specific instances. These instances include, but are not limited to:

- Applying for a grant
- Soliciting non-cash donations 
- Soliciting monetary donations
- Nonprofit rates   

**What if my situation does not fall into one of the above categories?**  

Please contact us if your individual situation does not fall into one of the above categories. We’ll work with you to figure out whether or not it is appropriate to use our IRS determination for your specific situation.  

**How do I obtain permission to use your IRS determination?**  

Please contact us to seek permission to use our IRS determination letter. We allow use of our IRS determination on a case by case basis so when contacting us, we’ll need to know:

- Who is asking for it? What is her/her/its address?
- Why are they asking for it?
- Is there an application involved?
- Is there a contract involved?
- When is it needed?  

**How long will it take for you to send Fractured Atlas’s IRS determination?**  

It really depends on the situation. It could take us 1 business day if it is for a simple donation that does not require an application or anything else, or it could take us 10 business days if it is for a grant, in which case we’ll need to review and approve the grant application. In all cases, please let us know when you need the IRS determination and we’ll try to email it to you by that date. Please do leave a few days for back and forth in case we have some questions about your situation.  
  
**Note:** The Fractured Atlas staff reserves the right to deny permission for use of Fractured Atlas’s IRS determination. Using the IRS determination in a specific situation without written permission for that situation is a prohibited activity of our program and is grounds for termination of your fiscal sponsorship.

If a project cannot fulfill its plans, we suggest that you use any funds you have raised to cover all associated project expenses (even if it didn't yield a finished product, there are usually expenses incurred along the way that you can use your funds to pay).

		<field name="title">What is fiscal sponsorship?</field>
		<field name="content">Fiscal sponsorship is a fundraising tool that enables an individual, group of individuals, or organization to raise funds using some of the benefits of a 501(c)(3) organization. 

To dig a little deeper, our fiscal sponsorship program is technically what is called a *grantor-grantee relationship*. This means that an individual, business, government agency, or foundation contributes money for a sponsored artist, project, or organization to Fractured Atlas which then grants the money to the sponsored entity for project-related expenses. 

One reason fiscal sponsorship exists is because most private foundations are unable to make grants directly to individuals. Public 501(c)(3) charities (like Fractured Atlas), on the other hand, are generally able to give grants directly to individuals. Hence, fiscal sponsorship allows a foundation to grant the money to a charity sponsoring a project they want to support that is lacking its own exempt status and then the charity can grant that money to the project.

Fractured Atlas fiscally sponsors artistic projects that are not-for-profit in nature and have a benefit to the public.

		<field name="content">You must be a member of Fractured Atlas to take advantage of our services and programs. Since fiscal sponsorship is one of our programs, you must be a member to use it. Please note that Community Members are restricted from using our fiscal sponsorship program. 

Before you can apply for fiscal sponsorship, you must sign up as a member of Fractured Atlas at one of our dues-paying levels - either the Professional level ($10/month) or Organization level ($20/mo).

The only difference between the two membership levels is the number of user accounts that you get. If you only need one user account, you can still sign up at the Professional level even if you're applying for fiscal sponsorship on behalf of your company. 

The Organization level of membership gives you up to three users, so you can have three authorized contacts on your account. We are only able to share sensitive information or instructions regarding your fiscal sponsorship to authorized users on your membership, so if you plan to have multiple people interacting with us, you will need to join at the Organization level. 

Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](/site/about/privacy) for more info.

You're welcome to switch back and forth between our different levels of membership at any time. Any questions regarding your membership can be directed to our staff.</field>

		<field name="title">How can I get a business bank account if I am not incorporated?</field>
		<field name="content">**You are not required to have a business bank account**, but we *STRONGLY* suggest you have a separate bank account for your project. This means you can simply open a separate personal checking account.

To open any bank account, we suggest approaching a local bank to inquire about what is required to open such an account. Keep in mind that smaller, independent banks (or better yet, non-profit credit unions) often charge the lowest fees and provide better customer service than the large corporate banks.
### Business Bank Accounts

**If you'd like to open a business bank account,** filing a Certificate of Assumed Name (aka DBA Doing Business As) with your County Clerk's office is usually enough for an individual who has not incorporated a business to open a business bank account as long as an individual is willing to personally guarantee the account. We *WILL NOT* provide you with our IRS Determination letter to open a bank account.

Some banks may require official documents stating that the business entity exists (Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, etc) but if you hunt around, you can probably find a bank that will help you out – after all, they are in business to take people’s money. Again, you are not required to have a business account, you can also open a separate personal checking account, so long as your own personal finances are not involved.

Setting up a separate bank account for your business activities makes tax reporting easier and establishes a financial history for the project/company.

		<field name="title">Can you accept donations in the form of cash?</field>
		<field name="content">Unfortunately, the answer is no. We cannot accept and process donations of cash because they do not provide a paper trail back to an individual. Without a paper trail, there is no way to certify that the person receiving the tax receipt is the donor. We must be very strict about this since we can get in big trouble with the IRS if we issue receipts to donors who didn't actually contribute to us.

		<field name="content">Please follow these instructions for check donations, to ensure that your donors' contributions are correctly processed for the purposes of your project:

1. Have your donors make checks payable to Fractured Atlas.

2. Your donors should then mail those checks to you directly, so that you can report them on your My Fiscal Sponsorship page using the online donation report form. 

3. Within two weeks of receiving the checks and reporting them online, you should mail them to our office for processing. Our address is:

Fractured Atlas  
Attn: Fiscal Sponsorship  
248 West 35th Street  
10th Floor  
New York, NY 10001  

4. We process check donations within a business day of receiving them in our office. Upon processing, we generate tax receipts and send them to you by e-mail. You are then responsible for forwarding those tax receipts to your donors, along with your thanks.

5. For check donations of $1,000 or more, we require a Major Gift Letter which can be downloaded as a PDF on our website.

**Please note:** Checks that are sent directly from the donor to the Fractured Atlas office may be mailed back to you or the donor.

		<field name="content">For donations made by check, you must report these contributions on your My Fiscal Sponsorship page before forwarding on to us for processing. 

1. Log-in to our website and go to your My Fiscal Sponsorship page.

2. Under the Donations button, click the &quot;Report&quot; link below &quot;Checks.&quot;

3. Select an existing donor from the dropdown menu or create a record for a new donor. A mailing address is required for the purposes of the tax receipt that we issue.
 
4. If you've created Giving Levels on your fiscal sponsorship online profile, you will be able to select the applicable Giving Level from a dropdown menu under 'Donation Information.' If you haven't set up Giving Levels, no dropdown menu will appear.

5. Be sure to include a &quot;Non-deductible portion&quot; for contributions where you award the donor goods/services in exchange for their donation. The non-deductible portion is the fair market value of the rewards that you are offering to your donors.

6. If the donation is for $1000 or more, you will be able to upload a signed Major Gift Letter to the donation report form. If your donor has yet to complete the Major Gift Letter, you are not required to upload a document in order to submit the report, but the donation will not be available for you to request until we receive the signed letter. The form letter is available for download from your My Fiscal Sponsorship page under Donations.

7. The 'special notes' field is for you to add a memo to the donation report for your own future reference.

8. Click 'Report Donation.' You will need to submit a separate donation report for each check that you've received. </field>

We're happy to process check donations of $1,000 or more without a Major Gift Letter, but these funds will not be available for you to request until we receive a completed letter.

Credit card donations do not require a Major Gift Letter. We can accept credit card donations up to $20,000 per transaction.

Your Annual Report should detail what you did with the funds we gave you specifically for the calendar year from January 1st until December 31st. The Annual Report form is another online form that we provide via our website (accessible only when logged in). It contains a narrative section and a budget form that all projects must complete. If you have kept decent records, it shouldn't take more than 15 - 30 minutes to do this. 

Any project that does not complete an Annual Report by the deadline will have its fund frozen until it is completed. If your fund is frozen, Fractured Atlas will not accept donations for your project and you will not be able to release funds.</field>

We can accept almost any type of donated noncash item for the purposes of a project and issue a receipt to the donor for the item. 

The one exception is vehicle donations, which we do not have the facilities to process in accordance with IRS regulations. Donations of intangible services (like pro-bono accounting/legal help or free rent of any kind) are considered IN-KIND donations by Fractured Atlas. These donations are very valuable but are not tax deductible under the law and therefore, we cannot issue a receipt for donations of pro-bono services or free space.

		<field name="title">How do I report noncash donations?</field>
		<field name="content">Here are the steps for reporting noncash donations to our fiscal sponsorship program for the purposes of issuing a tax receipt.

1. Before you report donations of non-monetary property, please have your donor complete the Noncash Donation letter. If their contribution is valued at $250 or more, we will require that you take a photograph of the donated item(s). For donations of $5000 or more, we will require than an appraisal be conducted on the donated items.
2. Log-in to our website and go to your My Fiscal Sponsorship page.

3. Under the Donations button, click the &quot;Report&quot; link below &quot;Non-Monetary Property.&quot;

4. Select an existing donor from the dropdown menu or create a record for a new donor. A mailing address is required for the purposes of the tax receipt that we issue.

5. As with all donations that we process for the purposes of our fiscally sponsored project, we charge a 7% administrative fee. For noncash donations, this fee is assessed off of the stated value of the donated item(s). We can deduct the administrative fee on noncash donations from your available fund balance or you can select 'Use credit card on file to pay admin fee' and we will charge the 7% fee to your card once the donation is processed by a fiscal sponsorship staff member.

6. You will be able to upload the Noncash Donation Letter and, if applicable, the photo of the donated item(s) if the contribution is valued at $250 or more. One or both of these items will be required before the fiscal sponsorship team can process the contribution and issue a tax receipt.

7. The 'special notes' field is for you to add a memo to the donation report for your own future reference.

8. Click 'Report Donation.' You will need to submit a separate donation report for each donation of non-monetary property that you've received.

		<field name="content">Your sponsorship may exist in perpetuity as long as your membership remains active and your project is in good standing. When the time comes for you to end the sponsorship, there are two ways to close out your sponsored fund.

- **Terminate:** If you terminate your membership with Fractured Atlas, your fiscal sponsorship will also be terminated, since membership is a requirement of sponsorship. If you terminate your membership before you have submitted your Annual Report, you are still required to submit an Annual Report. Our staff can answer any questions about this.

    If you have funds left when you terminate, a staff member will contact you about next steps.

- **Expire:** If you have completed your project and want to maintain your membership with Fractured Atlas, please contact support@fracturedatlas.org. We have the ability to “expire” your project in our system once you have submitted your final Annual Report. Marking a project “expired” in our database allows you the ability to apply for a new project in the future.</field>

All credit cards that are processed on the Indiegogo website are charged through PayPal. Indiegogo charges a 3% fee and Fractured Atlas charges a 7% administrative fee. **Please keep in mind that each donation received through the Fractured Atlas-Indiegogo partnership is charged a 10% fee in total.** In order for this to work, the Indiegogo campaign will need to be directly linked to your fiscally sponsored project.

		<field name="content">It is a best practice of fiscal sponsors to provide oversight for the funds processed through their fiscal sponsorship programs. The oversight is necessary to confirm that the funds are being used for appropriate expenses related to the charitable activities that were approved by the fiscal sponsor’s board. A charity cannot spend funds for purposes unrelated to their mission, so a fiscal sponsor needs to make sure the funds released to its fiscally sponsored projects are being used in a charitable way. Fractured Atlas provides oversight in three ways: 

1. We require a breakdown of expenses when the funds are requested.
1. We ask for fund release documentation and require it in some cases.
1. We require an annual report from anyone who has released funds throughout the year. </field>

1. *Log on* to [www.fracturedatlas.org](www.fracturedatlas.org) and go to your My Fiscal Sponsorship page.  

2. *Click “Accessorize!”* and you’ll see a list of services to which you can link your fiscal sponsorship.  

3. *Click “Indiegogo”* (click it again), and a sidebar will appear containing information about Indiegogo and its partnership with Fractured Atlas.  

4. *Click “Create a NEW campaign on Indiegogo.”* When you click this link, an account and draft campaign will be automatically created for you on Indiegogo.com. Please check for an email from Indiegogo which outlines the steps you will need to take in order to access your Indiegogo account and campaign.  

5. *Create your campaign!* For tips about creating a successful campaign, please [click here](site/blog/2012/09/26/tips-and-tools-crowdfunding/). You can also check out [Indiegogo's Help Center](https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us). Please remember to include the values for each perk in the field labeled, “non tax-deductible amount,” on the edit page of your campaign.  

6. *Click “Review &amp; Launch”* once your campaign is complete and you’re ready for us to review it. Fractured Atlas will receive an email notification alerting us that you’re ready to have your campaign reviewed and approved. We’ll review it within 5 business days (though we can usually review it within 1-2), and we’ll approve it if we think it’s ready to go.  Once approved, the campaign will go live immediately. If we have questions or edits for the campaign, we’ll reach out to you directly by email to address our concerns.  

**If you’ve run an Indiegogo campaign that was linked to Fractured Atlas:**

1. *Create a new campaign* using the Indiegogo account you’ve used for your Fractured Atlas campaigns in the past.  

2. *[Contact us](mailto:support@fracturedatlas.org)* with the URL for your draft campaign and we’ll take the necessary steps to have it connected to your fiscal sponsorship. Please make sure to do this before clicking “Review &amp; Launch” so that we can review the campaign while it is still in draft mode.  

3. *Add non-deductible amounts as necessary.* This field will not appear until after your campaign has been manually linked to your fiscally sponsored project.  

4. *Click “Review &amp; Launch”* once your campaign is complete and we’ll proceed as above.  

**If you’ve run an Indiegogo campaign outside of your Fractured Atlas fiscal sponsorship:**



1. *Log on* to www.fracturedatlas.org and go to your My Fiscal Sponsorship page.  

2. *Click “Accessorize!”*  

3. *Click “Indiegogo”* (click it again), and a sidebar will appear containing information about Indiegogo and its partnership with Fractured Atlas.  

4. *Click “Connect to an EXISTING Indiegogo Account,”* and enter the email address associated with your Indiegogo account in the pop-up.  If you’ve already started creating a campaign, this should automatically link the campaign draft to your fiscal sponsorship.  If you have not started creating a campaign, go ahead and put together a draft and [contact us](mailto:support@fracturedatlas.org) with the URL so we can have it manually linked to your project.  Once it’s linked, go ahead and add any relevant non-deductible amounts for the perks.  

5. *Click “Review &amp; Launch”* once your campaign is complete and (you guessed it) we’ll proceed as above.  

It is very important that your campaign is linked to Fractured Atlas or we will not be able to process the donations and they will not be tax-deductible. If you are ever concerned about whether or not your campaign is successfully linked to Fractured Atlas, please [email us](mailto:support@fracturedatlas.org) and we’ll gladly let you know. Unfortunately, if the campaign is not linked, there’s no way for us to know it exists, so we’ll rely on you to let us know about any subsequent campaigns you run.   

**How can I tell if my Indiegogo campaign is connected to my fiscal sponsorship?**  

If you do not see one of these clues, then your campaign is probably not connected to Fractured Atlas and you should [contact us](mailto:support@fracturedatlas.org) with the URL for your campaign.

1. *Check for the Fractured Atlas logo.* If your campaign is linked to your fiscal sponsorship, the Fractured Atlas logo will appear above your perks.  

2. *Check for the Fractured Atlas Standard Text.* The standard text will appear above campaign description that you’ve created for the campaign.  

3. *Check for the “non tax-deductible amount.” *If your campaign is linked, then a field marked “non tax-deductible amount” will appear below the “Contribution Amount” field for each perk on your campaign’s edit page.  

Once you’re sure your campaign is connected to your fiscally sponsored project and we’ve approved it, you’re as good as golden!

		<field name="content">There are a few things you can't do with fiscal sponsorship:


- You can't apply to certain funding sources that only accept applications from exempt organizations and disallow applications from fiscal sponsors (like the NEA). 
- You cannot get a nonprofit bulk mailing rate. 
- You cannot accept vehicle donations (the IRS restrictions governing how vehicle donations must be processed are incompatible with our program). 
- You cannot submit a fund release request for expenses incurred before your project was approved by our board. 
- You cannot use Fractured Atlas's sales tax exempt certificate for purchases. 

Other than that, you can take advantage of many benefits that are normally afforded to an exempt organization.</field>

		<field name="content">**Finding Other Members**

Click on [Member Directory](/site/members/) under the Community link at the top of the website. From there, you can peruse information that other Fractured Atlas members have listed in their public profiles. You can search by name, artistic discipline, or any other tidbit of information that you're interested in. Please note that not every member has a public profile and, if they do, it might not always be updated with recent information. Still, it's a good way to find out about other Fractured Atlas members.

**Contacting Other Members**

It is possible to view other members at Fractured Atlas, but we do not provide a mechanism to email all of them. If you'd like to get the word out about an event, simply post it to the [Calendar of Events](/site/events/).

If you find a specific member you'd like to contact through our Member Directory, you have the ability to contact them by following these steps:

1. Click on &quot;Send a private message&quot; beneath their Member Profiles. 
1. An alert that they have a private message will be sent to the email address they have on file with us. 
1. Should their email address be current, and should they wish to contact you in return, you will receive an alert in your own inbox stating that the member has replied to your private message. Simply click on the link in the email, log in to the website, and you can view the message. 

As we hold our members' personal privacy sacred, we do not give out member phone numbers, mailing addresses, or email addresses. If you cannot locate a member through our Member Directory and would like to initiate contact with a specific member, please call our office. We can contact the member on your behalf and provide them with your contact information.

The most common reason this happens is that the expiration date of the card has changed, but has not yet been updated in our system. Please log into your account and go to My Stuff -&gt; Billing Info/History to ensure all your details are up-to-date. The page will show you the last four digits of the card you have on file, as well as the expiration date and billing zip code. If all the details are the same as your current card, please contact us to run the card again for dues payment.</field>

		<field name="content">Fractured Atlas cannot provide you with a list of donors because, believe it or not, the individuals who are most likely to contribute to support your work are already within your orbit. You should start by asking your nearest and dearest - friends, family members, co-workers - to consider making a donation. Then, encourage your early donors to share your project with their own network of friends, family, etc. to expand your potential pool of donors. You should also take a look at the community who your work is intended to benefit and identify potential prospects. Then, share that list with your inner circle to see if anyone can facilitate introductions so you can share your work with these members of your community.

		<field name="content">Fractured Atlas can only sponsor arts enterprises that are non-profit in nature. 

A non-profit project is one that has a major public benefit; the work is intended for a larger audience and not for the private benefit of a few select people. A non-profit project also does not solicit the support of commercial equity agreements or private investors. If someone is contributing financially and expecting to receive a share in your profits, that person is an investor and your project is for-profit in nature.

You're welcome to make a profit on your project - and we hope you do - but any profits made would need to be spent on supporting the work itself, which could include paying yourself and your collaborators for their time and talents.

If your artistic project has a major public benefit and does not involve outside investors, then you should be a good fit for our fiscal sponsorship program.

		<field name="title">FAQ for Renters</field>
		<field name="content">SpaceFinder is a matchmaking tool for renters looking for creative space, and spaces looking to promote their rentals. Powered by nonprofit Fractured Atlas, SpaceFinder is free to list or search for space.

### Frequently Asked Questions


**Who do I contact about renting a space?**

Fractured Atlas does not own and manage rental spaces, we provide regional online marketplaces for *other* spaces to be discovered and rented. So... it is best to contact a venue directly. Each space listing specifies a venues’ preferred method of contact so you know how to get the most speedy response.


**Is there a fee to book a space through SpaceFinder?**

Nope! There is no fee to book online.


**How does the information about rentals stay up to date?**

Fractured Atlas approves all listings before they get published. We follow up with a venue when a website link is dead, or a renter message bounces. Every six months venues are sent an email reminder to review their listing and update as needed. Calendars that show a space’s availability are automatically refreshed every day. If you see a listing that is inaccurate, please let us know and we will reach out to the venue.


**Can you help me find affordable space?**

We know it’s hard to find affordable space, that’s why we built SpaceFinder! In addition to filtering spaces by rental rates within your budget, understanding your options to qualify for non-profit or subsidized rates is a good place to start.

For details, check out: [Tips for Finding Affordable Space](/site/knowledgebase/tips-for-finding-affordable-space)


**How do I share a shortlist of spaces?**

Once you’ve run your search, look above the map of search results and select the option “Save this search”. Your search will be saved to your dashboard. You can right click to copy the link and share it with your collaborators, great time saver.


**How do I find a specific type of space or amenity if there isn’t a search filter for what I need?**

Keyword search is a catchall tool for discovering new spaces based on super specific needs. Keyword search is helpful for when looking for a specific type of space like “church,” “outdoor,” or “gallery,” or when looking for a specific type of amenity like “3D-printer,”, “piano,” or “bar”. You can even get creative and search for keywords that connect you to spaces with a certain vibe, like “artist-friendly” or “corporate”.


**I see there are lots of options to filter space, how can I sort my search results?**

Search results can be sorted (ascending or descending) by name, size, seating capacity, and distance from a specific location. All of these options are found on the footer of the search results map.


**The venue I want requires ‘proof of liability insurance’, what is that and how do I get it?**

General liability insurance covers you for damage to other people and other people’s stuff. If you kick a hole in the wall, or kick an audience member through a wall (accidentally, of course), this insurance will cover the cost. Many venues require general liability insurance to ensure renter claims won’t get charged to their own venue insurance policy. You’ll need to provide a Certificate of Insurance, also known as COI, listing the venue specifically as ‘additional insured.’

For details, check out: [When a Venue Requires Liability Insurance](/site/knowledgebase/when-a-venue-requires-liability-insurance)


**How Do I bring SpaceFinder to my city or region?**

Fractured Atlas has expanded SpaceFinder from it's origins in New York City to serve over a dozen cultural hubs across North America. We continue to partner with local leader organizations to expand SpaceFinder into new regions and communities. To see if a SpaceFinder is planned for your community, vote to show your support for a planned or requested expansion or to make the case for the need in your community, please visit the [Feature Request Forum for SpaceFinder](/site/knowledgebase/feature_request_list?topic=SpaceFinder).</field>

		<field name="title">Adding Images to Knowledge Base Articles</field>
		<field name="content">Adding an image to an article is a four step process.

1. **Prepare your image.** Use an external tool to format and size your image. It should be:
  - **JPG, GIF, PNG, and SVG** are accepted file types. (At this time, PDF and other file types do not work.)
  - **600px wide or less, ideally.** The max width is actually 940px but that looks terrible on a small screen.
  - **Under 500KB**
  - **Annotate with red arrows.** This is usually the most visually clear option and will keep the look consistent across articles. Avoid annotating images with lots text because text in images is not picked up by search tools. 
  - **Make white space minimal and even.** The KB styling will automatically add a border to all images. This looks best when there is even white space around you images.
  - **Give context, but not the whole page.** Don’t crop screenshots too tightly. Users appreciate the context a wider shot gives them. However, showing the whole screen is rarely necessary and makes an article look dauntingly long.
  - **Exclude browser crud.** Unless showing the address bar is critical to your point, crop it out of your screenshots along with browser tabs, scroll bars, and the Fractured Atlas footer.
2. **Upload image.**
  1. Go to the [asset upload page](/admin/Knowledgebase/asset_form).
  2. Choose the file you want to upload and click &quot;Add.&quot;
  3. Check that your file appeared in the &quot;Recently Added&quot; section.
3. **Embed image.**
  1. Navigate to your article.
  2. On right, under &quot;Recently Created Assets,&quot; click on the thumbnail of the image you want. (If you can't tell from the thumbnail which image This will select the image URL.
  3. Copy the image URL.
  4. In the content toolbar, click the image button.
  5. In the modal, paste the link to the image.
  6. This will paste some code into the body of the article. Go into that code and edit the image alt text and image title.
  7. Check the image in the preview mode.
4. **Add required text.** When you insert a link to an image, the default code will say something like this &quot;[enter image description here](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=9 &quot;enter image title here&quot;).&quot; You need to modify two parts of this code:
  - **Image alt text** describes an image so people who have disabled images in their browsers or are visually impaired and use a screen reader will know what the images depicts. Replace the placeholder text &quot;enter image description here&quot; with a description or delete it.
  - **Image title** is the text that appears when a user mouses-over an image. Replace the placeholder text &quot;enter image title here&quot; with a relevant, short, catchy, and concise title.
5. **Check it!** Duh. Flip to preview mode and check that your image looks right in the article.

### Image Tips
Dealing with images can be the most time-consuming part of writing an article. These tips and work-flow suggestions may help speed that up.

- **Include Numbers in File Name.** If you are adding several images to an article, it will be easier to find the image you want in the Recently Created Assets if you save the file with a names like &quot;1SellingTickets,&quot; &quot;2SellingTickets,&quot; &quot;3SellingTickets.&quot; That way, when you mouse over the image thumbnail in Recently Created Assets, you will see the file name and know which image link to copy and insert.
- **Upload All Images, Then Write.** If you know where your article is going, it may be helpful to prep and upload all your images first, and then start writing the article and formatting the text.
- **Borders** will automatically be added to all images in articles. This default styling puts a solid gray line 1 pixel wide on all sides of the image. If your image a lot of white space on one side, the border will draw attention to that lopsidedness so try to keep the images evenly weighted.
- **Resizing** images within an article is possible with a little HTML. 
  - To resize with specific pixel dimensions, use code like this: `&lt;img src=&quot;/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=5&quot; alt=&quot;text&quot; title=&quot;title&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;&gt;`
  - To resize by proportion, use code like this: `&lt;img src=“/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=5” style=“width: 50%; height: 50%&quot;&gt;`
  - Maintaining correct proportions can be a little tricky with this technique though, so if you're not comfortable with it, just resize in an image editor before uploading to the assets library.
- **Adding images within lists** can mess up your list order. Add a space after the image to preserve the numbering. Indent your images so they stay in-line with the outline levels.
- **Tables** can be built in a third-party tool like [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#) and copy-pasted into your articles. 

### Videos
Videos cannot be uploaded to the asset library, but you can link to hosted videos on sites like YouTube and Vimeo.
 
  1. Go to the video hosting site and find the embed code.
  2. Copy the code.
  3. Navigate back to your KB article.
  4. In the content toolbar, click the video button.
  5. In the modal, paste the embed code.
  6. Video will not play in preview mode, so you will need to save the article and view in agent browse mode to check that embedding worked correctly.

		<field name="content">&lt;h3&gt;What is a community directory?&lt;/h3&gt;

A community directory is a custom branded SpaceFinder landing page of spaces relevant to a specific community. For example a specific geographic area or specific creative discipline.

&lt;h3&gt;Where do you find the community directories?&lt;/h3&gt;

Community directories are meant to be linked to from another organization's website. The directories are hidden landing pages on the SpaceFinder site, meaning you cannot navigate to them from within search.

**&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TazF20vEWsc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Click here to view a brief video showing navigation from Dance/NYC's website to their branded directory of dance spaces on SpaceFinder NYC.&lt;/a&gt;**

&lt;h3&gt;What does it cost?&lt;/h3&gt;

Community directories are provided at no charge as they function to increase visibility of and participation in SpaceFinder.

&lt;h3&gt;How long does it take to create a community directory?&lt;/h3&gt;

Fractured Atlas can build a community directory landing page within 2 business days (once the customized elements are received).

&lt;h3&gt;What types of organizations have asked for community directories?&lt;/h3&gt;


- Arts Councils
- Arts Service Organizations
- Business Improvement Districts
- Creative Districts
- Film Festivals
- Fringe Festivals
- Municipal Agencies
- Neighborhood Alliances
- Schools

		<field name="content">**Share My Calendar is a free, smart, and easy way to promote your venues unbooked rental times.**

## This is how a published calendar looks:

![Calendar](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=423 &quot;calendar&quot;)

&lt;p&gt;Depending on calendar software (Google, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.) there are different steps to generating the iCalendar feeds used to upload to Share My Calendar, however the whole process only takes about 2-3 minutes and these are all the benefits you will reap:&lt;/p&gt;

## Attract new renters
&lt;p&gt;Renters searching by availability are matched to your listing when your calendar shows space as available. This is a great way for new renters to discover your space.&lt;/p&gt;

## Promote last minute openings
&lt;p&gt;Calendars uploaded to SpaceFinder refresh automatically once day. Many venues post last minute openings of availability on social media, pretty hit or miss in terms of effective marketing, Share My Calendar is a way to automatically connect with renters actively looking for space, including any last minute openings, on a daily basis. Once a day your update inventory is released into the SpaceFinder marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

## Boost your ranking in search results
&lt;p&gt;Listings with calendars provide renters the convenience of viewing availability and are therefore rewarded with a boost in search results.&lt;/p&gt;

## Display unbooked times, not booking details
Renters only see colored blocks of time on your calendar as Available or Not Available. No details of your booking are displayed in the calendar. This makes it easy to maintain privacy around who else has booked your space, while also marketing your unbooked times.

## Combine more than one calendar
&lt;p&gt;If you use multiple calendars to keep track of different types of activities in your space  (i.e. classes, events, rehearsals) you can combine as many icalendar feeds as needed to reflect availability in a space.&lt;/p&gt;

## Say &quot;sorry&quot; less, and &quot;yes&quot; more
By displaying availability you reduce time spend saying &quot;sorry, I don't have space at that date and time&quot;, and increase your time spent saying &quot;yes, that time is open for booking&quot; to renters who are matched to you based on availability.

1. Verify the bank account information on file. If it matches the most recent EFT form and check that the user sent in, we'll need to request updated bank documents and deduct the $10.00 fee.
2. If the information we have on file is not correct and was entered incorrectly by an admin, then we do **not** need to deduct the fee.

**Follow up email to the producer should include:**

- Notification that we received notice from the bank saying that the settlements failed.
- Request for updated EFT documents. (If applicable)
- Explanation of $10.00 fee for resettlements. (If applicable)
- Details for each settlement that was resettled. (Show, Show date, Total net amount settled)

**To initiate the resettlement:**

1. View the user's organization in Artful.ly Admin.
2. Hover over the failed settlement and select the &quot;Resettle&quot; button.
3. The system will ask whether or not you would like to deduct the $10.00 fee.

		<field name="title">Troubleshooting Log In Problems</field>
		<field name="content">If you're receiving a call to troubleshoot logging in over the phone, try to find out what is happening first. Here are some things to look out for:

- Is the member receiving any sort of error message? If there is an incorrect email/password error, check for any multiple member records. Do you see multiple email addresses for different accounts? If the member is resetting the password on their own, the temporary password might be going to the correct email address, but for a different account. If the member does not want to change the email address on file for the account OR if they have only one account with us, feel free to reset the password for the specific account they're trying to log in to. Remind the member to log in using their username instead of email address. If the member says they don't require the other accounts (e.g. they have multiple older Community memberships), you can offer to merge the accounts. You can do so by going to the Membership tab in HD → Merge Members. You will have a form with the option to enter the two accounts you wish to merge.

- Is the member saying they have not received the login reminder email (reset password) from us? Ask them to kindly check any spam/junk folders in case it got filed away automatically. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes for them to receive it in their inbox. If you have reset their password recently, you can also check to see if their email bounced back for any reason. You can check this by going to the Helpdesk tab in HD → Bounced Emails. You can enter the email address you want to check in the search bar on the right hand side of the page. If you see that the email bounced back, you can check for the reason. If the member's email address is correct and they're inbox is not over quota, try clicking the &quot;Whitelist?&quot; link located right next to their email address in the search results. Then reset the password again to see if they receive it now.

- A general rule of thumb is to take note of the browser and browser version the member is using. We say that our website works best on up-to-date versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Our website does not display correctly on Internet Explorer, so kindly advise the member to use a different browser if they use IE to access our website. If they're not using IE, guide the member to clear their browser history and trying again. Also, opening up a new page or an Incognito window in Chrome might be a quick fix.

- Is the user's browser zoomed in? Sometimes this will bump the member bar out of view.

- If for some reason, you need to get the member logged out and they're unable to, send them the logout link: [www.fracturedatlas.org/site/members/logout](http://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/members/logout)

		<field name="content">## What does integrating Artful.ly with MailChimp do for me?

Connecting your Artful.ly and MailChimp accounts will allow the two programs to share patron contact information. Specifically, the integration will:

*   Copy your MailChimp subscribers into Artful.ly
*   Add new MailChimp subscribers to Artful.ly on a rolling basis
*   Display which MailChimp lists and groups an individual is subscribed to on his/her Artful.ly record
*   Allow you to add an individual to a MailChimp list directly from his/her Artful.ly people record 
*   Indicate if an individual unsubscribes from a MailChimp list or if campaign email to them bounces 
*   Log an action on an individual's record when you send him or her a MailChimp campaign 
*   Log an action on an individual's record when he or she opens your MailChimp email
*   Ask your patrons to opt-in to your mailing list when they checkout on your Storefront, at the Box Office, or through the Sales Console 
*   Use Advanced Search filters to find people who are or are not subscribed to specific MailChimp lists and groups 
*   Define a list segment using Artful.ly Advanced Search filters and add the whole segment to a MailChimp list or group

## How do I set up this integration?
This is a multi-step process, but thankfully you only have to do it once!
 
**Step 1: Get Your MailChimp API Key****

1.  If you don't have a MailChimp account already, [create one](http://mailchimp.com/) and set up at least one list.
2.  [Log in to your MailChimp account](https://login.mailchimp.com).
3.  Navigate to [this page](http://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api).
4.  Scroll down, click the **Create A Key** button. A new row will be added the the Your API Keys table. 
5.  Copy the string of letters and numbers that make up the **API Key**.  

    ![getting the MailChimp Key](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=563 &quot;getting the key&quot;)

**  
Step 2: Enable the MailChimp Kit in Artful.ly**

1.  Log in to Artful.ly and navigate to your **Account Administration** page.
2.  Click on the **Kits** tab.
3.  Click the **Add** button next to the MailChimp tile.
4.  Click the **Activate MailChimp** button.
5.  Paste your MailChimp API key into the field and click **Set API Key** button.

**Step 3: Configure Your MailChimp Kit Settings in Artful.ly**

1.  On the top right, select one or more lists from the **&quot;Which MailChimp lists would you like to sync?&quot;** area.
2.  Below that, select the one list you want fans to join when they check out.
3.  Below that, you can customize the text your fans see when they are asked to join your list at checkout.
4.  Click **Save**. Depending on the size of your MailChimp lists, importing and creating Artful.ly records for everyone may take some time.

		<field name="content">Artful.ly can help you find potential household pairings among your existing contacts. There are two ways you can search for existing households in your database:

1. **Advanced Search**: find existing relationships to create list segments, tag records, export information, and more. 

2. **Exports**: create a spreadsheet of people in your database to work with the information outside of Artful.ly.

## Search &amp; Report with Households

Once you turn on the Relationships Kit, you will automatically get a few more filters in your Advanced Search options.

1. Under the **People** tab, click on **Advanced Search**
2. Click on the **Relationships** tab. 
3. Select your desired relationship type and perform the search.
4. Press the **Work with...** button at the top of the page to perform various actions on the search results.

 ![Advanced Search by Relationship Type](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=828 &quot;Advanced Search by Relationship Type&quot;)     

## Exporting Household Information

A people export will include a Household column so that you can search for members of specific households in your spreadsheet. 

1. Under the **Reports** menu, select **Import/Export**
2. Select **Export People** to download a CSV file of your patron database.
3. Use sort and filter functions in your spreadsheet application to find individuals who are part of Households.

You may run into a situation where you need to end a membership before it expires.

1.  Open a Patron Record and click on either the **Membership ID Number** or **Member Tag**. This will open the patron's Membership History.  

    ![David_Richard_People_Record.PNG](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=565 &quot;David Richard People Record&quot;)
2.  Check the box on the Membership you wish to cancel.

    ![Work_With_Manage_Membership_Cancel_Membership.png](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=567 &quot;work with manage membership cancel membership&quot;)

4.  You will then need to Confirm the cancellation. A refund will be possible if the funds from the purchase have not settled. Membership revenue settlements issue two full business days after the membership is sold. If the funds have settled, your organization may issue refunds through your own internal refund procedures.

## Refund Memberships

A membership may also be canceled and refunded just like you would a ticket. This may be done so long as the funds from the purchase have not settled. If the funds have settled to your bank account, your organization is responsible for refunding the customer based on your organization's refund procedures. 

Go to the top menu bar and select **Orders** and **Memberships**. Or find the order from a patron's record. Click on the order to view the order details. 

To refund from the order: 

1.  Navigate to **Orders** at the top menu bar and click **Memberships**. Or find the order on a patron record and view the order details.
2.  Check the box for the order you need to refund.</field>

After we activate the kit, new functionally will now be added to your organization, and you will be able to:

- Define a relationship between any two records (spouse, friend, primary contact, etc.)
- See the relationship on both records 
- Use Advanced Search to find people who have a certain relationship type on their record
- Create a household that allows you to see the attributes of two or more individual records together 
- Find potential households with the Suggested Households report 

## Defining the Relationship

Relationships can be created between any two records in your database&amp;mdash;both individuals and companies. 

1.  Make sure both sides of the relationship have a record. If you just have one half of the relationship, go to the **People** menu and select **New Contact** add the other individual or company.

2. Open one record click the **Work With** button and click **Edit Info**.  

    ![Work With Button Edit Info](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=573 &quot;Work With&quot;)

3.  Click **Relationships** in the side bar.  

    ![Relationships Button](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=574 &quot;edit info&quot;)  

4.  Select a relationship type (see list below) 

5.  Start typing the name of the other individual or company. Select that record and **Save**. 

The relationship will now appear on both patron records. Relationships appear on the left-hand side of any record. 

If a relationship is really significant, you can click the **star** next to it. Starred relationships stay at the top of the list.  

   ![starred relationship](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=575 &quot;starred relationship&quot;)

## Relationship Types

When you create a relationship on one record, a reciprocal relationship is created on the associated record. Some relationships are between two people, and other relationships are between an individual and a company. These are the various types of relationships you can log:

| Relationship Type      | Reciprocal Relationship |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| affiliated with        | affiliated with         |
| alumnus/alumna of      | has alumnus/alumna      |

The relationship types list is fixed to allow for optimal performance. If the relationship type you need isn't on the list, you might try &quot;affiliated with.&quot; However, if customizing relationship types is a priority for your organization, please vote for this functionality in our [Feature Request Forum](https://artfully.zendesk.com/forums/318163-Feature-Requests).


## Search by Relationship Type

Sometimes it will be useful to see all the records that have a single type of relationship.

1.  Go to **People** and click **Advanced Search**.
2.  Choose **Relationships** in the side menu.
3.  Select the relationship type you want to see in the dropdown menu.

This is great if you want to, say, send a mailing to all of the parents in your network. To find the parents, you would do a search for everyone with the &quot;parent of&quot; relationship type.

![parent search](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=779 &quot;parent search&quot;)

## Relationship Tips 

* Never go to bed angry. (For real.)
* When you define a &quot;spouse&quot; relationship between two individuals, Artful.ly will suggest they be joined in a household. Read more about that [here.](/site/knowledgebase/beta-creating-households)
* When you define an &quot;employed by/employs&quot; relationship between an individual and a company, and the individual does *not* have a company listed on her record, then Artful.ly will automatically fill in the company name on her record.
* Some relationships can only be made between a person and a company. When creating a relationship between a person and a company, it's easiest to create the relationship from the company record. When you start from the company, you only see the relationships that can be made between a company and another record.
* You can view all the relationships an individual or company has right on their record. This is useful for seeing the details of who one person knows and how she knows them. For example, if you have a board member with a number of prospective donors assigned to her, you can go directly to her record and see who she is assigned to solicit.

## What is Householding?

Householding associates two or more individuals into a &quot;decision making unit.&quot; Most commonly, this refers to spouses who live together and make financial decisions together. A household may also include children or other relatives. The rules of who and what constitutes a household are up to you.

When you do choose to join two individual records in a household:

*   Both individuals keep their own individual record.
*   A new household &quot;view&quot; is created that combines the actions, notes, and tags of the household members. 
*   You define the household name and address.
*   Any future transactions still take placed at the individual level, but can also be seen at the household level.
*   You can use Advanced Search filters to define what record types you want to see&amp;mdash;just individuals, just companies, just households, or all record types.

## How to Create a Household

1.  Identify two individuals you want to household. (If you only have a record for one partner, create a record for the second before creating the household.)
2.  Navigate to one individual's record.
3.  Click **Work With**.
4.  Select **Edit So-And-So's Info** 

    ![Courtney_Household.png](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=578)  
    
5.  Select **Households**.

    ![Hollinor-Wellington.PNG](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=579)

## Viewing Households

Once a household is established, you see all the members on the people records in the household.

1.  Clicking the **View** link on a record will take you to the Household Record. Here you'll see all of the activity in the household aggregated in one place.  

    ![Courtney Household](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=578 &quot;Courtney Household&quot;)  

2.  On the household record, you can see notes, actions, ticket sales, donations, and lifetime household value. This information is compiled from each member of the household's record.  

    ![Michaels-Wendell Household](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=579 &quot;michaels-wendell&quot;)

If you click **Edit Household** you'll find a few more aspects of the household that can be edited:

*   **Basics** lets you rename the household.
*   **Address** lets you update the address information. You can use the Populate From dropdown menu if you already have the household address on a patron record. 
*   **Overwrite member addresses** checkbox applies the address to every member of the household.  

    ![Edit Household Info](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=582)

*   **Add Individual** lets you add additional members to a household. Note: Each record can only be a part of one household.
*   **Delete** eliminates the household, but not the people records.

## Suggested Households

Artful.ly detects individuals you may want to join into households. These are suggested based on the following criteria:
- **Address**: Address Line 1 and the first five digits of the zip code match
- **Relationship**: Type is &quot;spouse&quot;

To view suggested households, 

1. From the top navigation bar, click **People** and select **Suggested Households.**
2. If you want to create a household, click **Join**.
3. If you know the individuals are not members of the same household, you can click **Ignore** and the suggestion should not appear again.

 ![Suggested household example](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=630 &quot;Suggested household example&quot;)

We recommend you review the suggested households for your organization at least once a month.

		<field name="title">Creating Demo Accounts for Users</field>
		<field name="content">## When is it appropriate to give a user a demo account?

We don't want to hand out demo accounts to just anyone. Doing so can create unnecessary friction in user acquisition. The prospective user may be confused by the idea of a demo account or expect that we will be able to transfer their data from demo to production. 

On the other hand, some prospective users may be hesitant to try Artful.ly at all without a preview. These will often be larger or more established organizations with a lot of data to move and set expectations. These organizations are also usually worth more to us so spending extra effort to reel them in with demo account pays off.

Use your judgement to determine when a demo account will be helpful and be prepared to spend extra time with these prospects.

## How do I create a demo account?

1.  Start on the [Fractured Atlas Staging site](https://staging.www.fracturedatlas.org/). 
2.  Sign up for a new membership.
3.  Note the email and password you used to create this account.
4.  Go to [Artful.ly Demo site](https://artfully-demo.herokuapp.com/signups/collect_info)
5.  Create a new org.
6.  Name the account org after the real organization you're working with and signal that it's a test or demo account. This is to prevent Artful.ly staff from using this account for screencasts/shots and the remind the user that they are not in production mode. For example, if you are creating a demo account for the folks at Keen Company, name their Artful.ly demo org something like &quot;Keen Test Account&quot; or &quot;Keen Demo Account&quot;.
- Emails are not live in Demo but use safe fake emails just in case.
- Make the password something easy to relay, like &quot;password&quot;.
- Make the timezone whatever timezone the prospective user is in.
7.  Click &quot;Create My Artful.ly Account&quot;
8.  Navigate to &quot;Account Administration&quot; page.
9.  Add the appropriate kits (probably just donation and ticketing kits).
10.  Log out of user account.
11.  Log into [Demo Admin Panel](https://artfully-demo.herokuapp.com/admins/sign_in).
12.  Find the org account you just created.
13.  Add a fake bank account and approve the kits.
14.  Tell prospective user that their account is ready to go (see below).

## What do tell the user about their demo account?

1.  Use the &quot;Demo account set up&quot; macro.
2.  Point out any features or articles you know the prospective user is interested in.</field>

		<field name="title">Searching for Artful.ly Orders</field>
		<field name="content">Sometimes people get confused. They don't read their emails, see 'Artful.ly' on a credit card statement, or have no idea what that's all about. Lucky for us, there are easy ways to find their orders and remind them which show they saw or organization they supported.

### Ask for this information:

- **Name** on the credit card (Or the names of anybody who has access to the credit card: husband/wife, children, other family, etc.)
- **Date** of the charge (Keep in mind that sometimes the date posted on their CC statement may be a day or two before/after what we have in our records.)
- **Amount** of the charge
- What is listed as the description or merchant name on the statement? (If this says &quot;Fractured Atlas&quot; rather than &quot;Artful.ly&quot; you will not find the order in Artful.ly. Try looking in the Fractured Atlas admin panel for a fiscal sponsorship donation or membership dues.) 

###Finding an order in Artful.ly

1. Log into [Artful.ly Admin](artful.ly/admin)
2. Use the Find an Order field by typing a first and/or last name, order number.

 ![Order Search Field](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=599 &quot;Order Search Field&quot;)

### Still can't find it?

If there is confusion about who purchased the tickets, which credit card was used, or what event the customer saw - you'll have to search through the database a little more meticulously. You still need at least SOME of the information above, like the day of the charge on the statement and the amount. Oftentimes, the order is usually under a different person's name.

1. Go to https://www.artful.ly/admin/orders/artfully
2. Scroll through listings based on date. As you progress through the orders you can adjust the URL slug to change the page number where it says &quot;Page=&quot;.
3. For order details, click on the order number.

 ![Order Details Page](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=600 &quot;Order Details Page&quot;)

If all else fails and you cannot find the order in Artful.ly admin, request the **last four digits of the credit card** and speak with someone on the finance team who can look it up by date/CC number.

### Congratulations, you found the order!

Resending a Receipt: 
1. Open the order details.
2. Click Copy Receipt.
This will send a copy of the confirmation email to YOU (to whatever email you used to log into the Artful.ly admin panel). From your email, you can send the receipt or a screenshot of it to the patron or organization as necessary. </field>

		<field name="title">Merging &amp; Terminating Member Records</field>
		<field name="content">_Merging member records is an ongoing part of database hygiene that all Fractured Atlas staffers contribute to. It's a critical chore that ensures we all have easy access to the most holistic view of a members experience across the organization._

Merging is an action that can not be undone, and there are certain scenarios where multiple memberships for an individual is correct, so best practice is to 'Measure Twice, Cut Once'. Below are guidelines for merging (and the occasional rare termination) of a member record.


![Measure Twice Cut Once](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=757 &quot;Measure Twice Cut Once&quot;)


### Common Scenarios for Merging
- Member is also has a separate donor record under the same contact info
- Member created multiple accounts with different emails but one is definitively most recent

### You Should Probably Merge Two Memberships When...
- The contact info on both records is identical
- The two records are not for two different fiscally sponsored projects
- The two records do not carry insurance for separate legal entities

### You Should Probably Leave It Alone When...
- There are two fiscally sponsored projects
- There are two separate legal entities being insured
- There record was created for invoicing purposes only (i.e. a Customer record/not a membership record, created by Jillian - double check!)

### What Happens When You Merge Two Records?
- This stuff is combined:
  - Customer service history
  - Member payment history
  - Member donation history
  - Insurance coverage history 
- This stuff gets ditched:
  - The &quot;loser&quot; record's name, email, address, phone numbers

TIP: If you are unsure which info should be overwritten, take a quick screen cap of both records BEFORE the merge, so you can reference and update a certain fields if need be. Example: When the loser record has the most recent physical address, but an out of date email.

### How to merge

Tip: If you are trying to merge an individual that has more than 2 memberships, open each member record in a new tab to compare in order to determine the 'winning' record.

1. In the Fractured Atlas Admin panel - Go to 'Membership'
2. Select 'Merge Members'
3. In field for 'Customer # 1' start typing the member name or email, auto suggest will provide some options, select the member and you will see a preview of the contact info
4. Do the same for 'Customer #2'

### What do you see just before merging?

- The first record you select (Customer #1) will be the 'winner' record and the second one (Customer #2) will be the 'loser' record

![Merge Example](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=756 &quot;enter image title here&quot;)

### You Should Probably Terminate a Membership When...
- This action is very rare, in most scenarios is a merge is preferred. Exceptions include: 

   - Test membership records
   - Member specifically requests termination of membership while fully understanding downgrading, opting out of communications or merging as alternatives to termination.
   - You know that the individual no longer works at the associated organization, the email uses the domain of that organization, AND you have no way of personally contacting or finding that person to update info on their member record with new contact info. (Example: venues that have closed and membership records with staff emails with first name/last name that is &quot;Rentals Manager&quot; or a pass thru email 'booking@examplevenue.com').

### More Tips

- Clarify with the member what overall details should remain on the record if you are unsure, this can often become a great touchpoint with a member on what is new with them (or us).

- The old member record that was merged will continue to show up in customer quick-search at first, just give it a spell and the search will update to reflect your merge changes.

		<field name="title">2015 August Staff Meeting Minutes</field>
		<field name="content">### Full Staff Meeting

**Thursday, August 6th, 2015**

**12:00-1:00PM**

**Minutes: Nicola**

### July Action Items (5 minutes)


- Take note that people will be gone, so plan to talk to people before or after they are away. -have done, continue to do
- Email Nicola if you want to be an all-staff meeting chair. -have people through December
- Email Jillian if you want to contribute food for the summer party, email Nicola your camp pictures, and send your music suggestions to Malcolm. -Summer party went well! thanks all, offsite people got postcards.
- Share the image of the month contest. Submissions close on the 10th, and then people will vote. -Jason not here, continue to do.

### 1.	Getting to Know You…(10 minutes)

We played a getting to know you game that Jillian devised. People wrote facts about themselves and then other staff had to guess whose fact it is.

### 2.	Three Minutes of Fame: Manual Cinema (Nicola)

	
-Manual Cinema is a performance group based in Chicago.
-They use a variety of techniques in their performances--Live acting, shadow puppetry, multiple overhead projectors.
-MLS and I saw their show Ava|Ada at 3LD
-They are pretty new members (March 2015), but they seem really interested in exploring it more. They looked into becoming a 501(c)3 but decided against it.
-Their work has been featured at the Metropolitan Museum of art, The Tehran Int'l Puppet Festival, and a number of other festivals and locations around the world.
-Besides their performances, they also have an arm called Manual Cinema Studios--where they hire out design, animation, sound, and music composition. They have done music videos and other such projects. They also hire out a photo booth.
-(watched video) http://manualcinema.com/adaava/
	

### 3.	Program Activities (35 minutes)

### 3.1	Director Reports

**3.1.1	Marie-Louise**
Almost at the end of the FY and have raised 1.3 million. This is 90% of budgeted raised, but is still strong. So far we have secured 1.2 million for next year. We found out that we are getting Duke. We are trying to work on upgrading website. If you know members to do testimonials with a picture and a quote, let me know. A separate item: diversity issue is major in funding right now. There will be a questionnaire for board and staff to fill out. I will send it soon and please fill it out.

**3.1.2	Lisa**
August is the hard deadline for migrating Opera America to new payment system. Neighborhood customization for Chicago is being worked on. There will be a draft of Chicago park directory--rentals of park spaces to artists and community members. Team is trying to clean up members who only have emails. This will be a big chunk of Aug time.

**3.1.3	Shawn**
Not a whole lot different than last month. Dan and Mauricio are working on P2G, Chap is redesigning member bar 1.1 (bar at top of screen that was added), Eric is on vacation and Christine has some as well, but they have been doing the maintenance for all the sites.

**3.1.4	Scott**
I'm back! Everything ran smoothly in insurance. The help was appreciated (with visa letters). Burning man will be going up mid August, so we are getting some uptick now. I hope to give an update after the dust settles. Applications will be available for general liability in September for performance .

**3.1.5 Ian**
It has been a little while since talked about advisory services. Besides the Chicago park district contract, I have been working for a while on Sustain Arts (a massive data aggregation project that originally launched in MI.) It hass not always been easy, but last year has been better. launched a portal in the Bay Area, and working on a new portal for Chicago in fall. 

**3.1.6	Selena**
We continue to plot along with feature development including expanding what can track in CRM (nick name, special name), multiple addresses, and logging what staff member made an order. For 501(c)3s: they can add instructions for donors, producers get an email, and can convert a ticket to a donation.
Q: Mail chimp? A: There will be a code review before release, hopefully soon.

**3.1.7	Dianne**
It's nearing the end of the FY and we still have some funds left. If you have a project to donate too, let Dianne know. 
We are making a change in IGG--all will now go through Paypal so fee is increasing (10% for any PayPal). We will no longer be getting donor contact info (no name, no address) so be aware. First and last name may be put in one field. We will get email address. 

Q: Why?  A:IGG is forcing us to, Paypal is not releasing this info to us or IGG.

Q: IRS?  A: for $250 and above, will reach out to all donors for contact info.

Q: What about a mailed perk?  A: will get address in IGG dashboard.
We are hiring another Program associate- third round of interviews are next week, so hope to start in August.
If people ask, we are not P2G, we are a consultant that helped them to redesign their website.

Q-If a project wants to use P2G, can they? A- not in most cases. It could be possible, but complicated.


**3.1.8	FS Revenue (Dianne) **

-FS growth has slowed significantly. 5.4% growth. We are trying to find new and exciting ways to boost the program. Projects can now accept investors. they are welcome to have investors if investors are separate from donors, and the goal still needs to be artistic purpose. 

Tim- It's real money that we are not bringing in, Dianne Adam and I  have ideas of what could be happening. Adam feels like we are doing what we need to do in the long term (Microphilanthropy, LA) but in the short term, this is something significant. We are figuring out what we can do on the offensive side.

Dianne- I wasn't going to scare people, but we need all hands on deck, It's something in the organization that we need to think about. We are open to any ideas, so if you have any run them past me.
Possible things causing the slow down- It's easy to become 501(c)3 with EZ form, we have spent more time on Microphilanthropy, and the popularity of croudfunding has grown.

We are thinking about opening up projects to accept earned revenue (ticket sales, paid from something else, sell things).

Tim- We should be smart of how we spend money, but also be smart about how we are attacking this. What can you do now, on a day to day. Short term and long term changes that have an impact. Direct all things to Dianne.
In film industry, we looking at people who might be interested in this investor change. Send and leads to FS.

Tim-It's been a huge process. It's hard to move a 401k. Thanks Jillian. We have a meeting this afternoon with Ritholtz.

**4.3	PKPR (Tim)**
After working with them for quite a while, we will be putting it on hold for a bit. We hit a pause. There are not a lot of public announcements that can happen right now. We will reconsider what we want in a publicist, but in future we might want to focus on very specific items/launches. We will take this time off and evaluate.

**4.4	Office Renovation (Tim)**

		<field name="title">Our Playbook (CC)</field>
		<field name="content">### VISION


Our vision is what we want the future to look like. This is our notion of a better world. It’s our big idea. It’s bigger than what we can realistically achieve as one single organization and will require decades of collaborative effort. It is the ultimate intended impact of our work. 

&gt;We envision an agile and resilient cultural ecosystem with a diversity of artistic voices and broad support for cultural activity.


### CORE PURPOSE


This is the grand and aspirational reason for our specific work and the existence of our organization. It is not necessarily unique, but it is why we get up in the morning. It is how we want to contribute to a better world.

&gt;Fractured Atlas exists to maximize humanity’s creative and expressive potential. 


### MISSION

This is what we do—the how and why. We may share a common vision with other organizations, but this is our unique slice of the pie. 

&gt;Fractured Atlas empowers artists, arts organizations, and other cultural sector stakeholders by eliminating practical barriers to artistic expression, so as to foster a more agile and resilient cultural ecosystem.
 

### CORE BEHAVIORAL VALUES

These values describe how we behave with one another and with our various constituents. We believe we are better at these things than the majority of organizations and they uniquely define us.


&gt; We...
&gt;
&gt;**Embrace Challenge.** We seek out challenging problems and relish opportunities to venture into unexplored territory. We are entrepreneurial and comfortable with high-risk, high-impact efforts. #EmbraceChallenge
&gt;
&gt;**Make It Happen.** We are agile, creative problem solvers with a pragmatic focus on concrete results. We do what needs to be done and do it well every day. #MakeItHappen
&gt;
&gt;**Seek Continuous Improvement.** We are curious, unafraid of change, and excited by opportunities to better our services, our systems, and ourselves. Innovations and good ideas may be incremental or radical, and they can come from any corner of the organization at any time. #SeekImprovement
&gt;
&gt;**Be Excellent to Each Other.** We invest our time in quality work and giving customers and colleagues alike our respect, recognition, and support. #BeExcellent


### GUIDING PRINCIPLES

These values may not be as quirky as our Core Values, but these are important commitments we make to our members and customers.

&gt; **Level Playing Field.**  Artistic success should be achieved through talent and hard work, and not hindered by other barriers.
&gt;
&gt; **Diversity of Voices.** We believe that society benefits from a diversity of individual voices in the arts.
&gt;
&gt; **Non-Curatorial.** We leave it to others to judge artistic quality.
&gt;
&gt; **Fair Price.** We believe that people will typically pay for services that are of value to them, and that this provides useful feedback to us as a service provider.
&gt;
&gt; **Scale.** We can reach more artists and offer lower prices when we leverage technology and operate at scale.
&gt;
&gt; **Transparency.** Intentionally sharing our processes and outcomes fosters learning and accountability. 


### OBJECTIVES

These are the goals we must achieve to fulfill our mission. Objectives guide our efforts as individuals and as an organization, and we measure our progress against our objectives regularly to assess how effective our work is.

&gt; We aim to help…
&gt;
&gt; Artists and arts organizations reduce frustration
&gt;
&gt; Artists and arts organizations raise and earn more money
&gt;
&gt; Artists and arts organizations save money and time
&gt;
&gt; Artists and arts organizations meet legal and contractual requirements for opportunities
&gt;
&gt; Artists and arts organizations feel in control of their creative and business identities
&gt;
&gt; Leaders make more favorable decisions on behalf of the cultural ecosystem


For a deeper understanding of our activities, outcomes, intended impacts, and the logic that connects them, please refer to the Fractured Atlas Theory of Change.


### STAKEHOLDERS

These are the constituents and groups we work with to achieve our objectives and mission. Generally, those at the center of the diagram have the greater stake in the success of our organization. That said, our environment is dynamic and our relationship to each individual stakeholder is somewhat fluid and contextual. 

There are people in each of those concentric rings who are &quot;true believers&quot; and they have been carrying the Fractured Atlas banner for years. And there are others who, despite a significant transactional relationship, don't give us much thought at all and wouldn't hesitate to move their business to someone else if a lower price were available. 

The important thing to understand is that we have a very complex constituency and the decisions we make should be considered relative to how they might impact any of these stakeholders.

![stakeholdermap](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=607 &quot;map of stakeholders&quot;)


### POSITIONING

Positioning is essentially our plan for success. It is comprised of “Strategic Anchors,” a collection of intentional decisions made to give ourselves the best chance to thrive and differentiate ourselves from competitors. These statements are not used publicly.


&gt; To succeed, we will...
&gt;
&gt; Cultivate a diverse portfolio of activities and revenue streams
&gt;
&gt; Aggregate and share knowledge and ideas
&gt;
&gt; Attract and develop a lean, highly productive staff
&gt;
&gt; Invent and leverage technology



### PERSONALITY

If Fractured Atlas were a character in a play, this is how he or she would be described. Our personality is our voice, our style, and our attitude. It should be expressed throughout our communications and distinguish us from our peers. Channel these attributes when writing or speaking on behalf of Fractured Atlas.



&gt; Fractured Atlas is…
&gt;
&gt; Professional but not corporate
&gt;
&gt; Friendly but not sappy
&gt;
&gt; Cheeky but not snarky
&gt;
&gt; Smart but not inaccessible
&gt;
&gt; Authoritative but not autocratic
&gt;
&gt; Practical but not heartless
&gt;
&gt; Tipsy but not trashed
&gt;
&gt; Helpful but not your mother

		<field name="title">Fractured Atlas Theory of Change (CC)</field>
		<field name="content">### What is a theory of change?

Put simply, a theory of change is a visual depiction of strategy. For more on theories of change and logic models, please see [this blog post](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/blog/2012/06/28/in-defense-of-logic-models/) from 2012. (You can skip down to “What the Hell Is a Logic Model, Anyway?”)

Fractured Atlas's theory of change describes the strategic pillars of the organization's *mission*. Fractured Atlas is a hybrid organization drawing from both nonprofit and for-profit paradigms. In some cases the organization's business objectives (earned revenue, etc.) are served by achieving mission goals and vice versa, but not always.

## Fractured Atlas Theory of Change
[![FA TOC](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=752 &quot;FA TOC&quot;)](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/fa-toc.png) 

(Click image to view larger.)

## How to Use the Theory of Change

- **Let it help you decide what to measure.** What information is most important for your program to have? Are there any assumptions underlying your program’s success that seem especially vulnerable or uncertain? Does the theory of change show that certain objectives have to be met before any others are possible? If so, you might want to focus measurement or tracking efforts on those objectives or assumptions.
- **Use it as an onboarding tool.** Walking through a theory of change can be a great way to get up to speed quickly on the “big picture” of Fractured Atlas as an organization, and not just the details that you need to focus on day to day. A theory of change can be particularly effective at helping you understand how your work fits into a larger plan.
- **Use it in grant applications.** Many funders are accustomed to working with theories of change and logic models, and including one with a proposal can communicate that we speak their language and have thought seriously about how a program works. Depending on the situation, you might even be able to frame language in the proposal around it, for example to argue that the grant would support progress towards a specific, mission-critical outcome.
- **Learn from the theories of change of programs other than your own.** How well does your perception of how the other programs at Fractured Atlas work and what they’re each trying to accomplish match up with reality? Do the staff for those programs think about their goals or activities differently than you? Are there any concepts or measures they’ve come up with that you want to steal?


The most up-to-date version of Fractured Atlas's overall theory of change as well as theories of change for each program area can be found in the &quot;Theories of Change&quot; folder in the top level of the shared files system.</field>

		<field name="title">Membership Overview</field>
		<field name="content">**Types of Membership**

There are three different types of memberships: Community, Professional, and Organization.

The free Community level of membership provides access to benefits like free insurance quotes, the member calendar, SpaceFinder, Artful.ly, and special offers/discounts. SpaceFinder helps artists and arts organization find spaces in their neighborhood to either hold events, rehearse, and so on. Artful.ly offers artists a way to sell tickets and manage/communicate with their donors.

Professional membership has all the benefits at the Community level plus access to our full insurance program and access to apply for our fiscal sponsorship program. Since we are such a large 
member organization, we are able to offer our member good rates on insurance policies. Our fiscal 
sponsorship program helps artists fundraise for their works by incentivizing individual donations, obtain nonprofit rates, and more. 

Organization membership provides all the benefits at the Professional level for up to three authorized users.

**Why do we have memberships?**

We have different memberships for the varying needs of the artist community. The membership dues is revenue generated by Fractured Atlas that goes towards sustaining the programs and services that we offer. The dues goes toward paying support staff, general administrative costs, software maintenance, and development.

**How many members do we have?**

We currently have about 50,000 members. There are live stats posted on our website (www.fracturedatlas.org/site/about/membership), but a more specific breakdown can be found under the Membership tab &gt; Membership Stats.

**How much money do we make from membership dues and how is that revenue used in our org?**

		<field name="content">### Is it a bug?
Sometimes users will report things they don't like or features that are missing as bugs. While we do care about these kinds of issues, they are not bugs. A bug is a bug when it:

- Produces an error message
- Does not complete the action as expected (e.g., after submitting a form the changes are not saved)
- It is just broken (e.g., blank pages, odd behavior, errant calculations)

###How to write bug report
Before writing a bug report make sure that we are really dealing with a bug. The best way to do this is to find a way to reproduce it. Understanding the conditions that cause a bug will help expedite getting it fixed.

Once you have determined that we are likely dealing with a bug it is time to report it. When reporting a bug you will want to provide as much detail as possible. Always include the following details:

- Who (the user and type of user)
- What (what happened, what did they see, what did they do)
- When (yes, when it happened can be helpful as it allows developers to look through error logs)

In addition to the basics you should provide any other details including screenshots or screencasts. 

### Where to report a bug
If it is a not a bug that needs immediate attention you have a couple options for reporting bugs. If you have access to the Pivotal tracker for the piece of software that is having an issue you should create a bug story. If you do not have access to the appropriate tracker or are just unsure you can email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:bug@fracturedatlas.org&quot;&gt;bug@fracturedatlas.org&lt;/a&gt;. 

### What if it's on fire?!?
In the event that something needs to be addressed immediately you should post a message in Flowdock asking for help, using the @team tag will help to get everyone's attention.</field>

### Intro to Databases

There are many types of databases.  For the purposes of this document we're speaking of Relational databases (RDBMS)

**What it is**

A place to store the data associated with your application and your users.
A software program, just like Outlook, Word or Firefox. 

**What it is not**

A web application.  HighRise, Basecamp, Popplet, Foursquare, etc... are not databases.  They are web applications.  They use databases to store the data that you enter.

**What is so special about a database?**

ACID compliance
Atomicity - When you do a set of somethings, they should all work, otherwise don't do any of them
Consistency - When you do something, tidy up after yourself so that things are ready for the next task
Isolation - When you do something, don't interfere with others who may be doing something else
Durability - When you do something, it better be there in the morning.

**Brands of databases**

- MySQL
- Postgres
- Oracle 9i, 10g

**So what does your data look like?**

Data is stored in rows in tables
Table stores one type of thing: employees
Columns are the information that describe the thing: First name, last name, age, email address, company
Rows store information on one specific thing: An employee named Jim Smith
The table employees will have many rows, each containing information on one employee

MySQL: The most popular open source database http://www.mysql.com/

###Intro to SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is pronounced &quot;Sequel&quot; or &quot;S.Q.L.&quot; SQL is the language that you use to talk to your database. An SQL statement issued to a database is called a &quot;query&quot;

**Basic SQL syntax**

**Putting Data Into the DB**

INSERT INTO (table) 
VALUES (column delimited list of values) 
for example...

INSERT INTO employees 
VALUES 'Gary','Moore','33' 

**Updating Data in the DB**

UPDATE (which table) 
VALUES (the values that you want to change) 
WHERE (the criteria for updating) 

**Getting Data From the DB**

SELECT (the columns that you want) 
FROM (the table that holds the data we want) 
WHERE (the following conditions are met) 
for example, if you want to list all employees who are over the age of 30.

SELECT first_name, last_name, age 
FROM employees 
WHERE age &gt; 30
If you want all the columns, use *

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE age &gt; 30
Use AND to chain WHERE clauses

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE age &gt; 30
AND age &lt; 40
For partial matches, use the % character as a wildcard

SELECT first_name, last_name, age 
FROM employees 
WHERE last_name LIKE 'Smith%'

###  Intro to Internet

The Internet (with a capital I) is a global system of connected computers that serve data to each other.

**ARPANET**

Advanced Research Projects Agency Network - The first successful iteration of what would become the Internet. Developed in the late 60's by really smart people with financing and direction from the Department of Defense. Created, in part, to serve academic documents between universities but of course served many other needs.

Two principal technological innovations baked into ARPANET that were critical to it's success:

Packet switching
redundancy, surviving network links failing

**IP Adddresses and DNS**

IP Address = a numerical label assigned to devices connected to the Internet.  IPv4 (current and most common) is in the format NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN

DNS = Domain name service. The computer responsible for translating a domain name (yahoo.com) into an IP address NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN.  YOur internet service provider provides this service.  It is a distributed, fault-tolerant service that has o central authority.

		<field name="content">### Decision Analysis Training: An Introduction

Decisions, decisions! We make them every day, but how much thought do we really put into them on a regular basis? Research on human judgment and cognition tells us that the answer is usually “not much.” For this reason, improving the decision-making process is one of the highest-leverage capacity-building activities an organization can undertake.

As part of the Core Curriculum, Fractured Atlas gives its staff members an introduction to the innovative
techniques Fractured Atlas has used since 2013 to analyze decisions and place them in context. These workshops happen with a small group 2-3 times a year and last 3.5 hours.

### Curriculum and Learning Objectives

Fractured Atlas believes that research and data collection should be relentlessly tied to decisions
that matter. This introductory workshop explores how decisions shape organizational strategy
and tactics, covering the following topics along the way:

- **What defines a “good decision”**
- **Decision-making and uncertainty**
- **The role of measurement and prediction in decision-making**
- **Why measurement is easier than you think**
- **Better estimates through calibrated probability assessment**
- **When sh!t gets serious: building quantitative decision models**
- **A generalized method for analyzing and making any decision**

### Additional Resources

Fractured Atlas offers an advanced workshop series that covers quantitative decision modeling in more
depth. This training is optional and happens on an ad hoc basis whenever there is enough demand to support it.

		<field name="content">Jargon sucks. Avoid using it externally. 

But sometimes we _need_ to use it internally. Here are some of the uncommon words, abbreviations, and acronyms we use at Fractured Atlas and how they relate to organization specifically.

Feel free to add terms.

- **Affiliate** =
- **Agile** =
- **Additional Insured (AI)** = An entity that you add to your insurance policy that needs to be covered if they have an insurance claim that arises because of your activities. This is usually used when our members add venues or filming locations as Additional Insureds. You can add an entity as an Additional Insured by requesting a certificate for them.
- **Amazon Hosted Data Center** =
- **API** = 
- **Artsopolis** = A software platform primarily for cultural event calendars.
- **ATHENA** = Stands for Advanced Technology Hub and Extensible Nexus for the Arts. Artful.ly's name before rebranding.  
- **Authorize.net** =
- **Background Job** = A piece of software that runs outside of a user request. Required by tasks that could take longer than a normal web request (1-5 secs).
- **beta** = Before releasing major new software features, we often try to run a &quot;beta testing phase&quot; with a limited set of users. This helps surface bugs and refine the features before making the changes for all users.
- **Binder** = A temporary contract of insurance, oral or written, offered by an insurer pending issuance of a permanent policy. It is usually written for a period of 30 days and remains in force until a permanent policy is either issued or denied.
- **Binder Fee** = A fee paid directly to Fractured Atlas in order to put your coverage in place. Paying your binder fee means that you are accepting the insurance quote that was issued to you.
- **Braintree** = A merchant account vendor Fractured Atlas uses to process credit card payments for certain programs.
- **cascade** = Shorthand for &quot;cascading communication.&quot; This idea comes from Patrick Lencioni's book _The Advantage_. Members our leadership team leave each of their meetings having agreed on a common set of messages that they will communicate to their respective staffs within 24-48 hours after the meeting. What is important is that messages are being communicated consistently and quickly in a personal way. Staff members have the opportunity to ask their supervisors questions immediately and in person. 
- **Certificate of Insurance (COI)** = A document that evidences the existence of insurance coverage.
- **CopyCopter** = A third party software used to update copy (as in text and links) within a web application.
- **CRUD** = Create. Read. Update. Delete. It's an acronym that boils down the basic functions of most pieces of software.
- **Deployed** = This means the code or feature being referenced has been pushed to a server for viewing. Servers can be in *staging* or *production*.
- **EOB** = End of Business Day (often used for clarity on deadlines)
- **Future of Music Coalition** =
- **General Liability** = A policy that covers you if you injure other people or other people’s stuff.
- **GNU General Public License** =
- **GUI** = Stands for Graphical User Interface. It's what you're using to read this article right now. Instead of entering complex lines of code in a command line prompt, you can click on folders and icons that represent what you want to do.
- **Instance** = Each SpaceFinder web application is referred to internally as an 'instance'. We do not use this term externally.
- **Local Leader** = A title used in the SpaceFinder program when referring to local partner organizations we have written agreements with.
- **MDP** = These are the initials for our broker Maury, Donnelly, and Parr. We work exclusively with MDP who broker all policies for Fractured Atlas.
- **MVP** = Yep we have both MDP and MVP. MVP stands for Minimal Viable Product. It is used as short hand for getting the foundation of an idea shipped (often crudely and quickly) so it can be tested and refined.
- **OAN** = Open Arts Network. Fractured Atlas program allowing other member orgs to pass on our benefits to their membdernally.
- **Open Source** = 
- **Pareto Principle** = (also known as the 80–20 rule) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
- **Parkinson's Law** = Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.
- **PEBKAC** = A user error is an error made by the human user of a complex system, usually a computer system, in interacting with it. Although the term is sometimes used by Human Computer Interaction practitioners, the more formal human error term is used in the context of human reliability. User Error and related phrases such as PEBKAC (&quot;Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair&quot;)
- **PHP** = The original programming language used to build software at Fractured Atlas. Some systems are still written using PHP but most are written in *Ruby*.
- **Production** = An environment for an application that is public facing. This is the &quot;live&quot; environment for an application.
- **QA testing** =
- **Rake Task**= Same as *script*, but sometimes run on a schedule (eg, settlements running every evening).
- **Reseller** = A dormant module of Artful.ly. Designed to allow individuals or organizations to promote and resell tickets on behalf of Artful.ly producers. Producers would choose which tickets and how many they offer to a reseller. Resellers can choose whether or not to accept and resell those tickets and if they add a fee for their service. This kit is not complete and we currently do not offer it to members.
- **RESTful**= While REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural style for networked hypermedia applications, it is primarily used to build Web services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable. A service based on REST is called a RESTful service. Fractured Atlas built our own tool called [RESTful Metrics](http://www.restfulmetrics.com/) to track and report stats from our SpaceFinder platform.
- **roadmap** =
- **Ruby** = The programming language used to build most software at Fractured Atlas. Some systems still use *PHP*.
- **Ruby-on-Rails** =

- **Service-Oriented Architecture** = 
- **SOPA** = Stop Online Piracy Act, House bill, allow the U.S. Department of Justice and copyright owners to seek court orders targeting websites they accuse of infringing copyright.
- **Staging** = An environment for an application that allows stakeholders to test and verify software functionality. This is not &quot;live&quot; like *production*.
- **Theory of Change** = 
- **Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA)** = A federal law that has existed since 2002 that provides government backup for insurance claims that arise out of acts of terrorism. It allows you to purchase insurance that will still pay out if you have a claim as a result of a terrorist act.
- **WFH** = Working From Home</field>

		<field name="title">Visa Letter Basics (CC)</field>
		<field name="content">We write &quot;letters of consultation&quot; for O &amp; P Visa applicants. These are also known as &quot;advisory letters&quot; or &quot;advisory opinions&quot; or &quot;no objection letters.&quot; We can work with artists directly or with their immigration attorneys to complete these letters.

We have been doing these since 2008 and, to the best of our knowledge, none have been denied a visa due to our letter. We have completed these for artists and creative professionals of all types, including, but not limited to those involved with: theater (actors, directors, administrators), film/TV (actors, filmmakers/directors, designers, public liaisons for documentaries), visual art (painters, sculptors, photographers), fashion (designers, photographers, hair/makeup), design (architects, graphic designers), dance (dancers, choreographers), music (musicians, DJs, bands/orchestras, booking agents), radio (on-air personalities), literary (journalists, writers, editors), and more.

The basics on our service are:

- We only need the I-129, petitioner's letter, the artist's resume (if not already included in the petitioner's letter), and 3-4 support letters. If we have questions and need further information, we can generally find it through Google or we can request further documentation.  
The documents can be emailed (to support@fracturedatlas.org) or faxed (212-277-8025) to us. Once we have them, we can get our letter back within 3-5 business days (sometimes 1 business day with an additional $100 rush request).    

- We will email our letter to as a PDF. If it also needs to be mailed, we can do that, but there has never been a problem with our emailed letters, as they can be printed out and included in the package.
  
- We charge $200 per letter. If USCIS requests further evidence after their initial review (which usually means a more specific letter of consultation), we charge $100 for the second letter ($50 for paying members or Associate Members).
We accept credit/debit card (over the phone), check, or money order for payment. If the payment is coming from the attorney, we can send the letter before payment is received. If it's coming from the artist-applicant themselves, we must receive payment before we send the letter. We can invoice any party if necessary.  

- We are considered a &quot;peer group&quot; by USCIS. We are not a management or labor organization.

- We have a Special Offers section which attorneys can post to if they would like to offer discounted or pro bono legal service to our members.

- If someone wants more information about the actual process of obtaining a visa, they should be directed to [www.artistsfromabroad.org](http://www.artistsfromabroad.org) and should be urged to contact an immigration attorney. If anyone asks if we can serve as their visa sponsor/petitioner, we cannot, as we are unable to be responsible for their employment while they are in the U.S. It should be suggested that they contact an arts organization or artist that they have done business with in the past (or will be doing business with).

receive her approval. The Program Director shall be provided with a summary of the evaluation made with respect  
to each candidate. Particularly controversial or borderline candidates shall be flagged. The Program Director will
review visa requests once per week.  
- All requests will be honored in 3-5 business days. If a 1 day turnaround is required, we will charge an additional
$150 (for a total of $350) for the letter.  
- If the Program Director is unavailable for secondary review, the letters may be reviewed by the Program Specialist
in her stead.  
- Any particularly controversial or borderline requests should be reviewed by the Executive Director before issuing. </field>

		<field name="content">As part of Core Curriculum, Dianne will meet with new employees and discuss the following:

1. Definition of F.S.
  - Our definition
Fiscal Sponsorship is a fundraising tool that enables artists and arts organizations to use some of the benefits of Fractured Atlas's non-profit status to fundraise. This means they can get access to tax deductible donations and grants that are typically only available to nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations.

  - Different models
There are many models of fiscal sponsorship. Fractured Atlas operates what is referred to as a Model C or grantor-grantee relationship. Each project has a grant agreement with Fractured Atlas. 
  - History of F.S. (external &amp; internal)
  - Why it exists
  - Our business model
  - Legal &amp; IRS overview - oversight
  - Theory of change
  - National Network of Fiscal Sponsors
2. Who uses the program

		<field name="title">Feature Request Forum Basics (CC)</field>
		<field name="content">The [Fractured Atlas Feature Request Forum](/site/knowledgebase/feature_request_list) is an invaluable component of our software's community-driven design. 

Each program and major service area has a page/forum for feature requests (Artful.ly, Fiscal Sponsorship, Insurance, SpaceFinder, Membership, Visa Letters, Arts Entrepreneurship Awards, Other). 

### How New Feature Requests Are Created:

If someone suggests an idea that we haven't heard before, we'll add it to the feature request forum so other users can vote on it to show their support. If the request already exists, she'll add a vote to the original request, and sometimes a comment. 

- A member suggests a new feature through the forum.
- An admin suggests as him/herself.
- Admin creates on behalf of a member by [logging in as the member](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/admin/Knowledgebase/view_article?id=442), navigating to the feature request forum, and suggesting a new feature.

Regardless of who puts the request in the forum, they all get created the same way&amp;mdash;by clicking the suggest an idea link in the feature request forum.

![Feature Request Forum with an arrow pointing to the suggest an idea link](http://fracturedatlas.org/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=760 &quot;suggest an idea&quot;)

Comments can also be added to feature requests in these same three ways, but they all go through the comment field at the bottom of the request.

![Add a commment box on a feature request](http://fracturedatlas.org/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=761 &quot;add a comment&quot;)

When a new request is added to a forum, the program director receives an email alert. Read this article for instructions on [how to respond to and administer new requests](/admin/Knowledgebase/view_article?id=147).

### How Votes Are Added to a Feature Request:

- A member votes on a request
- An admin adds a vote as him/herself.
- An admin adds on behalf of a member (typically from a customer email) by logging in as the member and voting on the request. 
- A guest adds a vote.

Votes may be cast both the main page of the feature request forum, or when viewing a request in detail. 

![a view of the feature request forum with an arrow pointing to the vote button](http://fracturedatlas.org/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=762 &quot;vote&quot;)

or

&lt;img src=&quot;/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=763&quot; style=&quot;width: 80%; height: 80%&quot;&gt;

After adding a feature request or vote on a member's behalf, you should let the member know in an email  with a link to the request. 

Here is an example of some of the boilerplate used when the Artful.ly team responds to a feature request:

&gt;Thanks for your interest in Artful.ly and for your suggestion.

&gt;This is not a current feature, but we might be able to add it. I've subscribed you a relevant thread in our public Feature Request Forum and voted for this feature on your behalf: &lt;&lt;FORUM LINK&gt;&gt;

&gt;&lt;&lt;OR&gt;&gt; I have posted this idea to our public Feature Request Forum on your behalf: &lt;&lt;FORUM LINK&gt;&gt;

&gt;Please feel free to add comments to this idea or suggest other ideas. If we have questions orsend  updates, we will post to this request thread and you will receive an email notification.

&gt;As much as possible, we prioritize the features requests with the most votes. 

&gt;Thanks again for your feedback! Let us know if you have any other questions.

		<field name="title">Changing Membership Status &amp; Level</field>
		<field name="content">**Upgrading**  
Members can upgrade their membership at any time. They can go to My Stuff → Upgrade Membership. Alternatively, you can upgrade the member by going to the Membership tab in their record and selecting the requested level under the Type dropdown menu. Click Save button to finalize changes. It's also best to confirm that there's a next billing date for the member and that the dues were charged.

_Upgrading to Organization:_  
Provide steps for adding users (logging into account → My Stuff → Manage Users → entering user info and clicking &quot;Add User&quot;

**Downgrading**  
_Downgrading from Organization to Professional: _
This membership level change will leave only one user on the account (the Master User). Make sure that the master user on the account is requesting this change. If not, the master user can send an email to support to confirm that the other authorized user should be made the master user. After they do this, you can promote the other user to Master User and make the membership change (Membership tab in record → Type menu → Select Professional in menu → Click Save button.)

_Downgrading to Community: _
We want to keep our members as part of our community - encourage switching to the Community level if the member does not wish to pay dues or use all our programs and services for the time being. Follow same check procedure as terminating.

**Terminating**

If a member is requesting to cancel their membership, please check for the following:

&gt;_Fiscal Sponsorship tab_: 
Is the member actively fiscally sponsored by us? If so, check for any fund balance and fund releases. Let the member know that downgrading or canceling their membership will automatically end their fiscal sponsorship with us. If they're okay with that, have them request any remaining funds online and/or make sure to file their Annual Report if they haven't already.

&gt;_Insurance tab_: 
Check for any open applications (where a staff member is assigned to it) and/or any Active policies. Remind the member that although their active policies will remain in effect until its end date, Fractured Atlas will not be able to service their policies if they downgrade or cancel their membership. They will also not have access to request certificates of insurance online if they are not at a dues-paying level.

&gt;_Artful.ly and/or SpaceFinder tab_:
Encourage the member to switch to the Community level if they have used these services in the past. Remind them that at least a Community membership is required to use Artful.ly.

**Reactivating**
If a member wishes to reactivate their membership, make sure their Membership Type is toggled to Community and click the Save button (if they were not already Community members when they were terminated). Then click the Reactivate Membership link below the membership range date (underneath the different record tabs). Let the member know that they have been reactivated at the free Community level and provide steps for upgrading if they want to do that online in the future.</field>

Hey Jason,

Just a heads up that I added some content to the Membership Discount Codes IKB article that has been assigned to you. I did it because Adam had just released a new feature related to it.

The author of the article has now defaulted to me, but just wanted to clarify it is still on your task list to complete (I didn't steal it from ya - just contributed a bit)

**Open Arts Network (OAN) Discount Codes**

Example:

**Event-Based Discount Codes**

Example:

**Staff-Based Discount Codes**

Example:

Staff member Lisa Niedermeyer uses discount code '3FreeLisa' to offer 3 free months of membership to select people. Lisa has the option to be emailed when a new member at the professional level signs up with that discount code,  the email includes a friendly reminder to welcome that new member and a quick reference link to their member record. She keeps a small stack of business cards with this code on her to make it super convenient when networking and recruiting new members.

		<field name="title">Membership Refunds</field>
		<field name="content">_What's our policy on refunds?_

We can refund any dues transactions that have occurred in the past 90 days (three months). Any transaction beyond that timeframe will have to be coordinated with the Finance team.

If a member successfully and satisfactorily used our programs and services, we would generally not offer to refund the dues charged during that period.

If a member is requesting to downgrade their membership to the Community level or cancel, and you notice that they have been charged recently, it is a good customer service gesture to simply refund that latest dues transaction and let the member know they should be seeing that refund in the next few days.  

_What are the steps to conduct a refund?_
You can refund a dues transaction by going to the Transactions tab in their record and clicking Refund button. Let the member know they should be seeing the refunded dues in the next few days. If a transaction has a Void button instead of a Refund button, this means that the transaction has not been settled by us yet. If you click Void, you can let the member know that the charge will not post to their account (if they seeing a pending charge, it should drop off).

If a member is asking to refund dues and also a monthly donation they might have set up for the Fractured Atlas General Fund, please check in with Development Associate (or whoever is handling monthly donations for the FA General Fund) before refunding any charged contributions. If any donations to us are refunded, please let Development team know via email.

NOTE: A member will NOT be sent a notification/email confirmation of the refund.</field>

Resetting a password will send a login reminder with the username and temporary password to the member's email address on file. These passwords do expire (typically we say a day), so please communicate to the member that they should be using the most recent temporary password sent to them if they have repeatedly been trying to reset their password. Prompt the member to change their password by going to My Stuff → Change Password. The Old Password field will be the temporary password they just used to log in.</field>

**Out-of-Band**: This charge is for when a policy is purchased outside of an online application (or for specific endorsements) when we have the information for the carrier and type of insurance in the Helpdesk. It may be split into a binder fee and premium:

**Special Purchase**: For insurance, this is for when we do not have the information for the type of insurance in the Helpdesk. It may be paid for by the CC on file, a new CC, or through a fund release if the full amount is available.

PLEASE NOTE: Before charging a Special Purchase, confirm with the Program Director and Controller, as these charges would not be billed in the manner an out-of-band purchase or on-site purchase would be.

		<field name="title">Assigning Tickets</field>
		<field name="content">Every employee of Fractured Atlas has the ability to assign Helpdesk tickets, but it is normally handled by the program directors who oversee the Helpdesk during the day, who tag and then direct **Unopened Tickets** to the appropriate staff person.

![Unopened tickets](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=668 &quot;Unopened tickets&quot;)

  **Deleting a ticket**:  

A ticket comes into the Helpdesk in the New Tickets quadrant (upper left-hand corner). Occasionally, spam emails appear, which can be deleted.   

![Delete a ticket](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=669 &quot;Delete a ticket&quot;)

  Sometimes, spam looks just like real email and vice versa, so if you are not absolutely certain that it is spam, do NOT delete it. You can always View an email before actually opening or assigning it. Mass emails from members that are not directly for a staff member can also be deleted.

Any tickets that are not spam or should not be deleted should be either Opened or Assigned. We should respond to all inquiries (email or phone) within one business day per our Customer Service Pledge.

**Tagging a ticket**:


![tagging a ticket](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=670 &quot;tagging a ticket&quot;)  


Every ticket assigned in the Helpdesk must have a tag associated with it; some tickets are automatically tagged when the ticket is created, but others must have a tag (or tags) assigned to them. Only Program Directors have the ability to create new Helpdesk ticket tags, but any employee can tag a Helpdesk ticket as he or she deems appropriate. 

**Opening a ticket**:

![Opening a ticket](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=667 &quot;Opening a ticket&quot;)

This places you in charge of this Helpdesk ticket: you are now the one handling the issue and you will see it through to its resolution, whatever that might be. Do not open the ticket if it is not for you, or if it is a question that you do not feel comfortable answering.

**Assigning/Re-assigning a ticket**:

![assign tickets](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=671 &quot;assign tickets&quot;)

New tickets have a drop-down list of FA employees that you can assign the ticket to. Choose the best employee to handle the question asked.

Sometimes, you assign the ticket to the wrong person. If you've done this, use the &quot;reassign&quot; dropdown menu in the open ticket to select the correct staff member.

If you were assigned a ticket and do not believe you are the best person to answer the inquiry, you can reassign it to another staff member.

**Redirecting a ticket**:  

![redirect tickets](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=672 &quot;redirect tickets&quot;)  

Occasionally an email comes to the Helpdesk that does not belong there; it may be a personal or professional communication that should not be in the Helpdesk or is better handled by the staff member directly (a funder attempting to contact Adam Huttler, for example). Redirecting a Helpdesk ticket completely removes it from the Helpdesk system, leaving no record of it, and so this feature should be used with caution.</field>

		<field name="content">**Responding to Tickets**

It is always best to go through your open Helpdesk tickets at least once a week (picking a specific day, like Friday, makes it easier) to close out old tickets and to ensure that you've responded to all emails that need a response. Sometimes, a response can be easily missed, so it's good to look at the most recent email in each Helpdesk ticket chain. To access the tickets assigned to you, select **Working Tickets** under Helpdesk.

![(/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=736 &quot;Selecting &quot;Working Tickets&quot;&quot;)](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=736 &quot;enter image title here&quot;)

**Closing Tickets**

A Helpdesk ticket should be closed when the issue has been fully resolved. This can be done at your own discretion, but it is usually best to wait for the sender's final email, to confirm that the issue has indeed been resolved. If you feel that the issue has been resolved, but have not received a final email from the sender, you should feel free to close the ticket a few days to a week after your last communication. You can always re-open the ticket if necessary.

![enter image description here](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=737 &quot;enter image title here&quot;)

**Creating New Tickets**

Anytime you are working with a member on a specific issue, it is helpful for Fractured Atlas to have a record of it. If it's a phone conversation, note it in the CRM. If it's an email conversation, or something that will eventually involve email communication, create a new Helpdesk ticket by going to the member's file and clicking on **New Helpdesk Ticket**. Keep in mind, your ticket does not have to start out with an email. It will only send an email if &quot;Send Email&quot; is clicked. You can always un-click that and write a message about the issue that can only be viewed internally; notes like this are helpful if you know that further communication with the member on the issue is forthcoming.

![Creating new ticket](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=788 &quot;Creating New Ticket&quot;)

**Linking Tickets**

If someone sends an email or Helpdesk ticket that directly relates to a past issue, you should link the new ticket to the existing ticket chain regarding the issue. This way, all communication about that topic is viewable at once, rather than spread across multiple Helpdesk ticket chains. Only link tickets if it's clearly the same issue that is addressed throughout. Do not link a new ticket to an old ticket if it's a new issue, even if it's about an old topic. For example, if the person has an old Helpdesk ticket chain asking about Fiscal Sponsorship, but then sends a new email/ticket about a specific donation, there's no need to link those tickets.

**Recording Information in a Helpdesk Ticket Without Sending an Email**

As stated above, sometimes you want to record something that happened (a call for instance) as a part of the Helpdesk ticket chain, but you don't want to send an email to anyone. You can always unclick **Send by Email** to record a note without it being emailed.

![Deselecting &quot;Send by Email&quot;](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=739 &quot;deselceting Send by Email&quot;)

**Importing Emails to the Helpdesk**

If a member has emailed you directly (without going through the Helpdesk) in response to, or about an issue, their email should be linked to their member account so that we have a record of it. To import the email into the Helpdesk, you can either forward the email to support@fracturedatlas.org or, in the reply to the member, BCC: support@fracturedatlas.org. When the email arrives in the Helpdesk, make sure to link it to the appropriate Helpdesk ticket chain (if appropriate) and be sure to assign it to the appropriate member.

**Assigning a Ticket to a Member**

If a ticket is sent through the Helpdesk and it is not already assigned to a member, please be sure to assign it to the appropriate member so that we have it saved in the member's record. If the ticket is assigned to the wrong member, you can always detach it and then reassign it to the appropriate member.

![Assigning a ticket to a member](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=786 &quot;Assigning a ticket to a member&quot;)

**Detaching a Ticket**

If you incorrectly attached a Helpdesk ticket to a chain, you can detach the ticket by clicking **Detach from Thread** up by the ticket number. You can then reattach the ticket to a new chain, if appropriate.

![Detach from thread](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=787 &quot;Detach from thread&quot;)

**Re-assign Ticket to Another Staff-member**

On occasions where you need to reassign tickets to different Fractured Atlas staff-members, merely select **Re-assign** in the upper righthand corner of the Helpdesk ticket. Once reassigned, the ticket will go into the other staff-member's queue of working tickets.

![Reassign Ticket](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=735 &quot;Reassign Ticket&quot;)

**Set a Reminder**

To set a reminder, select the icon in the upper righthand corner of the ticket. 

![Set a reminder](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=742 &quot;Set a Reminder&quot;)

You will then receive an email reminder to check on the ticket at the time you select from the calendar.

![Set a reminder, Calendar](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=789 &quot;Set a reminder, Calendar&quot;)

**Mark a ticket as &quot;Waiting for a Response&quot;**

When you do not need to take action on a ticket but you are waiting for a response, you may select the **Waiting for a Response** icon. The ticket will then drop to the bottom of your queue of Working Tickets.

![Waiting for a Response](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=744 &quot;Waiting for a Response&quot;)

**Mark a ticket as &quot;High Priority&quot;**

To mark a ticket as urgent in your queue, you may select the icon in the righthand corner of the ticket. Once marked as High Priority, the ticket will be at the top of your Working Tickets.

### My Out-of-Office

When you are away and not responding to Helpdesk inquiries, remember to set your account to 'Out of Office' - this way customer service can be coordinated as needed.

1. Go to HelpDesk
2. Go to [My Out of Office](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/admin/Helpdesk/ooo_form)
3. Click 'I'm Away&quot; and SAVE
4. You'll notice a cute little &quot;Gone Fishin&quot; sign appear

*Pro Tip: Schedule a reminder to turn this off on the day you return back to work
*

### My Signature
Your signature will automatically be added to every Helpdesk ticket you write a response to. Check with your supervisor on what your signature should say.

1. Go to Helpdesk
2. Go to [My Signature](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/admin/Helpdesk/signature_form)

***Pro Tip: Signatures DO NOT allow for formatting or hyperlinks - keep it simple***

### My Auto-Reply

Auto-replies are sent out by email whenever you are assigned a helpdesk ticket (even if you assign it to yourself). Check with your supervisor on best practices for enabling this setting.

1. Go to Helpdesk
2. Go to [My Auto-reply](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/admin/Helpdesk/autoreply_view)

### My BCC Settings

It is common when a new staffer is in training that all their Helpdesk tickets be cc'd to a supervisor for the dual purpose of coaching and quality assurance.

1. Go to Helpdesk
2. Go to [My BCC Settings](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/admin/Helpdesk/bcc_form)

***Pro Tip: To remove BCC settings, delete the BCC email and save the empty form to overwrite***

9/29/2009 Staff Meeting


**Adam H.:** Adam spoke briefly about the two big ancillary tech projects for 2010, ATHENA and the Bay Area Cultural Asset Mapping project: ATHENA is likely to receive $350K from Mellon, on top of the $100K secured from Doris Duke. However, Mellon is sensitive to Gemini working on it so there will be little to no synergies with anything else, meaning more flexibility with staffing configurations for the project. More details soon! The latest update on the Bay Area Cultural Asset mapping project is that the Hewlett Foundation has invited FA as a finalist! – Both of these tech projects will expand FA’s identity and our organization’s abilities to serve the field in various capacities.

Alfresco snafu was a common complaint from Emily and others, mainly due to lost insurance data. Adam H. suggested we use Alfresco version backups until we figure out how to prevent data loss from permissions issues (and other “weirder” issues). However, opening up all permissions on folders would compromise the standardized maintenance system that has been put in place.

-&gt; Dianne and Emily granted highest permissions in order to better maintain work on Alfresco.

On the topic of sprinting to keep moving over files: there is still work to be done! A sprinting night needs to be scheduled soon to give everyone a chance to finish. Adam H. is going to Budapest (Oct 16-18) for Opera Europa. University of Wisconsin at Madison’s arts admin program also invited him to talk. The emerging leader program is also potentially having a conversation with him, via WNYC, later this month. Adam’s op-ed ran this Sunday, as well.


**Dianne:** Read Zappos article on customer service attitude – which is relevant in light of time recently spent on the phone assuaging an upset member. Are we not fostering an encouraging, positive attitude already? Positively spinning the info that we deliver to our members is always a good strategy that we tend to already practice, but when a member interferes with the staff’s ability to offer good customer service to the rest of the members, a line needs to be drawn. In some cases a member may be better served (emotionally) by a fiscal sponsor that offers more “intimate” and personalized relationships.

To what extent is customer service excellence within FA’s hirees, and to what extent is that a function of the organizational culture? Should star members and difficult members be given special flags viewable by staff? Adam will revisit the idea. Suggestion that Tim Cynova be tasked with delivering cookie cakes *via segway* to very, very special members.

Juliana and Dianne’s absence for fiscal sponsorship work in CA – September 30 through Oct. 13 (for Juliana) and Oct. 19 (for Dianne). Dianne will be online almost every day, and Kara and Rafael have been prepped for coverage for this period.

Emily Bowles complained about the member spotlight section – what are the criteria for selection? Do people read them? Juliana mentioned that some members really value them. Adam H. believes that the profiles are a good thing, and that the links established by profiled members bring in a lot of extra attention, in addition to giving us a human face and the impression of ongoing art production (rather than sterile, abstract service provision). A.H. wants to continue highlighting the diversity and breadth of the FA community. But as for managing the member profile system, Emily Bowles needs to be given more specific direction.


**Adam N.:** Two new Open Arts Network partners! United Arts of Central Florida and Fashion Research Foundation (the latter in Second Life).

Also, traveling from 10/2-10/6 in Atlanta (Foundation Center event, talk with Alternate Roots, talk with Athens and OCAF area arts councils, meetings with local orgs) and 10/7-10/16 in LA (college visits and meetings with those in music, arts ed, and dance).

**Tim: On Philly news:** Lois Welk, Director of Dance/USA Philadelphia, and chair of the Philly council, will be attending the board meeting this Saturday, Oct 3.

**Triathalon follow-up: **in spite of rainy weather there was a definite staff morale boost provided by the triathalon, which is vibrantly apparent in the wild-style video that Emily cobbled together out of sheer love. Some of us have signaled enthusiasm for a repeat occasion down the road (sans crap weather, of course).</field>

Kara presents on study commissioned by Wallace Foundation and conducted by Project Zero at Harvard Grad School of Ed. Understanding Excellence in Arts Education. Evaluating evaluation tools, improving education quality, defining quality for your self. Arts education as part of holistic education experience. 

**Tim - Logistics:** 


- Welcome Rafael.
- Friday, Sep 4th is end of summer Fridays. SCF will continue! Everyone says Woo-hoo. Email Tim if you think he may not have your summer Friday hours.
- Office cleaning, occurs during SCF.
- Fiscal Year started on Tuesday 9/1. Resets prof development funds. Start of fiscal year means new ticket allowance of $200/yr. Use credit card, get receipt, get reimbursement. Or ask Tim for his CC.
- FY 08. Budget stuff finishing up. Will send around draft next week. Hutt wants each program director to present on their numbers at next monthly staff meeting. Alex will also present on contributed income. Also, bonuses were based on 8% of year over year increases. Contributed income was down this FY, affecting bonuses. Program fees and membership were up.
A

- lfresco sprint. Member folders very close to tidy. Donor folders, not so much. Alfresco migrating folders probably nightly. Donor folders taking time because donor record needs to be created. Maybe add more folks to donor record team, but train them on creating prospect records. Last summer Friday is good time to work on it, since we close at 2. Talk to Hutt about syntax and migration issues. Wiki sprint on hold.
- Shelf sprint - task force! Kirsten and team will organize kitchen area. What’s the dish container for? For clean or dirty dishes?? Everyone needs to wash their own dishes, we’re adults. Also, the trash can in the kitchen is stinky. Also, consolidating items from other shelves in office. Talk to Kirsten about requests and ideas.
- Health insurance renewal. Current plan went up a lot ($100 per individual). Working on series of plans that may work for individuals. Sit down with Marie. Old plan will be “premium” plan. Many people will probably move to HMO. Is cheaper and more comprehensive. Also, high deductible plan with HAS that the difference of higher premium plan will be contributed. HMO is a go, we’ll need two people per plan, so will have to see if enough people will sign up. Tim will send around premiums so we can choose.
- We added big lock to the website to tell people that the site is secure, since there were concerns from members.

**Alex: **


- Triathlon campaign in full swing! Paper and email solicitation went out. Donations are at about $1200. Also got case of gin (!!!). Let Alex know if you want her to send solicitations to anyone. If we’re lucky, we’ll break even after all of our expenses. Cocktail reception is Tuesday, September 15th at the Brandy Library. Wear a prom dress. “Brown spirits” have not been donated, so we may buy some booze from the library to give away.
- Swag – Café Press and iron-on shirts. Staff supporters of Tri will probably get the iron-on. Donors will get café press shirt.
- 9/9/09 – Solicitation push to have people donate $9.09 through widget for triathlon. Massive solicitation, maybe to Community members, others. $1000 goal is possible?
- Team members – want to do a blog post? Pick a day or think about blogging if you haven’t. Emily lives in the ghetto and may not want to blog about running there. Lots of puns about running follow. Kara and Kirsten will cheer us on and booze with us. Angel will lead the tail-gating charge.


**Adam N:**

- Spoke to Michael Roderick from Small Pond Entertainment. Will develop production course for Fractured U. Also involved with some Food Network cook-off thing on November 18th. We may assemble team.
- 10 K Campaign –Co-Chairs will meet soon about this and update later via email.


**Kirsten:**

- PA spaces got a Mellon grant for research on rehearsal space for single choreography-led dance companies. Also, partnering with Department of Aging to get artist residency space in senior centers. Philly PA Spaces will begin soon, too! New website being built for adaption to any city…


**Dianne:**

- FS info session September 16th at23rd St Space. 65 people have RSVP’ed. 70 chairs being rented, 30 chairs there. Renting PA system, too. Kirsten will videotape it and it will go on the website. Natale requests that we brief other programs, too. Also trying to do one in San Francisco while we’re there for NNFS conference, and then one in LA while Dianne is there with Natale. Trying to contact OAN partners to find free space in those cities. Maybe Philly sometime soon, too. Providence, too?
- Fiscal Sponsorship Hot Topic call – Dianne co-facilitated with Katrina from Intersection for the Arts. Discussions about fiscal sponsorship.
- Roundtable for fiscal sponsors – asking VLA, NYFA, the Field and Foundation Center to help organize event to present FS to funders. Will try to get funders there to help them understand the program. Charlotte from Foundation Center cannot get funders there, but is willing to assist. No date set for roundtable.
- Staff videos – video footage of most staff with introductions. Also possibly doing program introductions. Can post to website so that people can learn more about us and our programs. Done by the end of September goal. Getting video content on the website!


**Tim – Where ya been, where ya goin: **


- Natale: to Atlanta in October to speak at Foundation Center annual event. Then some other orgs, probably. Then in LA, an administrator meeting for each discipline; Teaching artists, dance, and music. Also hitting some college classes and education programs. Then Natale to NAMP. Just got back from Orlando; they don’t need much beyond our services. Hopefully another OAN partner in that area.

**Adam Huttler **
Bathroom too small for so many people - we need to be respectful of each other while using it.
We’re going to have a soundbyte on NPR.
FracturedU is doing a soft launch and we’re just waiting on Kamal to do a blog post. It’s currently up, we just have not said anything about it yet.

Alfresco – it’s up and functional. Everyone should be using it and letting Adam know if there are any problems they encounter. As a company we need to figure out if we want to invest more money on software that works better.

10,000 member party – internal or public – possibly one small in Philly and LA. These would need to be paired with some other sort of event. Want to use it as an excuse to get new members and celebrate old members. Launching of Philly council might be a worthwhile reason to throw a party there.  We did not decide anything about specifics.  We'll have some sort of staff only celebration in NYC - we need someone to organize this event for the staff.  

**Discussion on membership drive. **
In conjunction with Aetna stuff….Philly membership drive. Alex wants to know what this means, do they get a discount – we’d probably mainly be getting community members. We’d have to do some sort of strength in numbers based appeal – can this be inexpensive rather than free? To bring in quality members – maybe offer free 3 months for full members if you join. Non profit finance fund – cultivating relationship in NY and philly might be developing some courses for FU – they’re running into some walls with entrenched senior membership and they are slowing down. 

Membership drive:

1. Geo specific
2. Discount on full membership – 6 months free code based on city 
3. Can we come up with some sort of incentivized reason for people to join? What will happen if we get xx # of members? If we get this target we can bring PAspaces to your city or offer them a HC plan that will be launched,  ??? other ideas 

Natale finds the term “membership drive” gross – Alex thinks of it as a very clear call to arms. 
Kara suggested a competition for membership between cities. We need to identify cities – Philly, LA, DC, Austin, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle. Top 10 cities in NEA report or randomly selected by region? Maybe the prize could be that we hire a filmmaker to come to their city and make a short about what are the arts places in their city - 5 minute video of 100 art experiences in the city. Will be made visible to other media networks. Membership smackdown – first one to get 1000, 5000 members? Host an event in the winning city. Natale volunteered to chair this competition.  All staff except Alex, Adam Huttler are part of the team.

**Alex**
Tri event sponsorship efforts by Alex – wet suit – she needs to know do they want wet suit. Launch on blog on August 10th. Sept 15th, Tuesday, cocktail party – people can sponsor by mile or make a donation.
Marie 
Philly Aetna _ Awareness campaign, goal to have 200 real enrollees at the end of Oct/Nov. There is a landing page where they can be directed to enroll for insurance through us. Slogan – Because Art is Dangerous – facebook page that is separate from ours that Marie is maintaining. Kicking into high gear in September. Events at some point, not sure what they’re going to look at.

**Tim**

Wiki sprint – maybe split into several days, chunks over time. Tentative 3 hours 3 days – what are the guidelines? Late August. Maybe do an Alfresco sprint to move over donor/member folders from legacy files.
Health Insurance renewal – our premium is going up $50 – might change our plans. Sept 1st.


**Adam Natale**

Social media marketing update  – getting a bunch of comments on FB. People seem to like it. Adam said that we’ve been getting members from it. Blog posts – keep it up, make sure you’re not posting too many times in one day. My stuff revamp spec being developed.
Can we get money to go see members projects.

**Adam Natale presents The Art of the Turnaround: Creating and Maintaining Healthy Arts Organizations by Michal Kaiser.**

Kaiser (President of the Kennedy Center) presents Ten Rules for business turnaround through, concentrating on leadership roles within performing arts organizations. The Ten Rules focus on developing a key turn-around leader based in confident and capable leadership with an eye on effective marketing techniques. Huttler questioned whether the text focused on developing a good leader or a good turn-around leader and how those would be different.

**Adam Huttler**

*Alfresco*

- up and running, Tim will set-up anyone who needs to start using it.
- One problem exists so far: cannot open or save PDFs directly.
- Member files will need to moved over from the last few days.
- AH is developing a function for CRM links to transition from the Donor/Member designation to Customer Files.

*New PA discussion*

The job search concentrated on ELNYA, Linked In, FA blog and word of mouth. Target start date: August 15th. Tim will collect resumes; staff should gather questions for interviews. Should the interview process be more streamlined? Possible phone interview, multiple rounds in person to be interviewed by multiple shifts of staff.

*White Label/Athena*

Should FA offer a payroll service?

*Need:
*
- During Philly meetings, payroll service was brought up frequently. Seeking out potential white label options. The service would focus on smaller organizations transitioning from 1099’s into employee payroll, with FA providing the support. Possibly dovetail with Fiscal Sponsorship and Liability Insurance (Worker’s Comp component). FA would provide education for best practices as well as understanding the difference between 1099s and employee pay. This would position FA to be of further assistance for administrative development.
*
Concerns:*

- How much ambiguity between questions FA can handle versus the outside vendor?
- What’s the value? Bundling smaller groups for a larger service; guidance from FA, and savings for the customer.
- Do our members actually need this service? Our members cover three transition areas: needing and not having payroll, needing and having payroll, or needing and not knowing they need payroll. In general not much has been heard from the membership; Should we do a blog survey?


**Alex**

*FA Tri Teams:*

- Main team: Huttler, Tim and Elizabeth
- Sprint teams: Emily; Juliana, Phil and Josh

*How to fund raise for it?*

- By July 20th: blog announcement
- Hopefully get some corporate sponsorship in addition to indivdual pledges for miles and straight donations.
- Blog updates on training
- Cocktail reception September 15th possibly at the Brandywine Library; liquor contacts will be investigated.
- Pass on possible supporters to Alex.

**Natale**

*Themed blogging:*


- 
- Emily Bowles: Member profiles
- Alex: Question of the Day
- How to’s : guest bloggers

- Tim: LinkedIn blogs

New OAN Partners: Association of Calligraphic Artists; Shasta County Arts Council; Pittsburgh Filmmakers among 7 regular arts councils.


**Dianne**

Fiscal Sponsorship Survey results: Blogged about the results. In general, a good deal of staff praise for Juliana and Emily. Questions about improved user interface: a personalized My Stuff page with the ability to modify the content. Inquiries about how useful the webcasts are. In general, need to offer multiple pathways for access to the info on the website.

What about a Live Help feature? (instant messaging for HD) First, need to wait for new PA to assess the staff capacity. Would be useful for simple questions whereas more complicated issues would need to be handled through email or over the phone. Check out: uservoice.com; getsatisfaction.com; Tender Support; HelpSpot

Offer a live chat function for Fiscal Sponsorship. Focus on developing videos for new or potential sponsees. Get new projects to help film from NY, LA and San Francisco

Dianne has been working with the National Network of Fiscal Sponsers to develop a best practices for Model C’s based on the Model A document. Will send out to the network to get feedback. Kirstine: Statistician: Ian Moss will help with data analysis for user searches in NYCPAS.


**Where ya been? Where ya goin’?**

*Dianne*

- Connecticut Film Fest: terrible turnout; 3 people attended the session and there were no walk-ups.
- Opera America
- VLA: July 10: talking about copywrite and trademarks
- DCA: interesting to witness dialogue/dynamic of the panelists.
- Interviewed by VenusZine: will get copy for the office
- Alex Long Island Radio

*Natale*

**Guest Presentor - Caron Atlas, Place + Displaced**

Caron Atlas—Featured guest speaker presenting information on Place &amp; Displaced. Caron sees herself as an organizer working to connect the arts with other industry sectors around issues of social change. She seeks to raise awareness among artists that the arts cannot self-perpetuate their own marginalization.
P&amp;D began with mapping 3 neighborhoods in Brooklyn which included: Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Bushwick around the interrelated phenomena cultural vitality of a community, gentrification, and displacement. The next area beginning now is Long Island City, with the Chocolate Factory as one of the partners. The philosophy behind the project simply is that information is important to make change. In other words, data and stories are necessary to make compelling arguments: information is power.

The process of mapping the arts in a community began to play around the issue of “visibility,” and hence, inclusion vs exclusion (“Are you on the map or not?” P&amp;D kept hearing from and/or coming across individuals who were not on the map). This brought up the questions around the definition of an “artist” ie., “Are you a baker that bakes and is creative or do you just bake? Where is the line?”

The project also brought to the light the issues around “community building,” as some communities had propensity to be extremely polarized. By contrast, it became apparent that there exists overlaps and alliances among different communities (ie. Manufacturers who are also artists).

The methodology of the project is based upon “participation action research” which involves having key partners well respected in the community to lead the research from within (vs an external organization infringing or encroaching a community). This helps to ease suspicions by the community members. The process is inclusive and slow. It approximately takes about 1 year for each neighborhood. Examples of partners include: El Puente, Arts in Bushwick, Williamsburg Gallery Association, North Brooklyn Development Corporation.
The project also involves augmenting any existing available data, (as arts and cultural mapping has become a popular practice) for instance, that of the Americans for the Arts. The information for Brooklyn is currently being massed and organized, while Adam Huttler is working on building the interactive map, with search functionalities. It will include neighborhood tours in video format, (whereby you can see, for instance, hidden sites where art in the community exists, ie. Subterranean site of a brownstone in Brooklyn where teaching artists help children learn how to read).

The survey part of the project includes questions like: “How do you connect to the arts? What’s your deal in the arts?” It also involves questions on social networking like: “Do you feel you are a part of this neighborhood? Are you involved in community activism?”

A number of people have asked whether P&amp;D has a stance or a policy/agenda it supports, but there are none predetermined policies, in order to remain true to the methodology of “participatory action research.” We are aware that displacement is occurring, and hints are provided in the survey results, which can inform policy at a later point.

Many questioned the integrity of the methodology of the project, and much time was devoted in the beginning to heed well the advice of social science research experts. Developing the survey took several months.
There is a possibility for the project to be open-sourced at a later point after the 1st curated version.
Currently Rockefeller is the biggest funder with a 2 year grant, applicable for 3 sites. There are several other funders as well.

The best attempt of an elevator speech for P&amp;D (as it is a difficult project to describe), includes the following: “Information is part of policy making. It involves making ties within communities and de-marginalizing artists. It’s focused on building healthy communities via basic political literacy in community activism (ie. Learning about what a community board is and how individuals can become a participant in it.” There were high expectations by some that the project would evolve into a separate service organization. However, one key consequence is to result in basic educational workshop on political community organizing.
P&amp;D has new logo which is a Venn diagram.


**Featured Presentation**

Kirsten Nordine gave a presentation on Artspace Projects.


**Ask the ED: Adam Huttler**


There are two efforts concentrated in the Philadelphia area which include bringing PA Spaces to Philly and marketing the Aetna health insurance plans.

Also, in the process of identifying candidates to establish a Philly Advisory Council to serve as ambassadors for Fractured Atlas. The idea is for this group to serve as a template model for other cities.
Ars Librera has a new name -- ATHENA = Advanced Technology Hub Extensible Network for the Arts. Open source software featuring seamless integration of applications ie. Ticketing and donor relationship management. Two interns will jointly develop a spec figuring out the necessary functional requirements for the 1.0 version (with the on ticketing first).

There will be a cash option for health insurance if an employee is able to obtain comparable or better coverage from another source (ie. Spouse).


Wiki: include one page with all links of frequently recommended outside resources for members (ie. VLA, Actor’s Fund) in one centralized location as well be included within the respective program departments. A wiki sprint was suggested again in order to update it and reorganize as a true functioning wiki as a narrative with an organic interlinked flow. Before a sprint is organized, a tutorial and structure should occur ahead of the wiki renovation.


RFC Re: Social Media It will be an ongoing strategy with a check in every 3 months. The goals and focus can be viewed in the wiki with the central theme of participating in social media beyond just “talking” about FA.


An RFC was suggested in order to discuss the idea of an FA conference to be hosted virtually. May be related to Fractured U can be conceived as interactive webinars.


FA will be conducting a feasibility study on starting a captive insurance company for the liability program (hopefully fully subsidized by MDP). The point in doing so would be to keep the premiums instead of passing it off to external insurance companies. It would also allow for FA to have more control and flexibility in providing insurance orgs or projects that are now deemed as too “risqué” or offensive by traditional insurers.


MDP will still serve as the General Agent under this new model. An update to the liability software is occurring now regarding renewals.


An FA Triathlon Team has been officially started by Adam H., Elizabeth, and Tim. The event is based in NJ on 9/27/09. An additional sprint team will include Emily, Juliana and Avi. Adam has reached out to the Board, and it is likely that we will field another spring team as well. For those not actively participating, cheering groups will be formed for more festive activities on the road. Special cycling jerseys/tees will be made. Conceived as a fundraising event, there are plans to be able to accept pledges. Alex is working on cultivation event opportunities.</field>

May 7, 2009 (Kirsten)


**ACTION-ABLES**

- FA Book Club -- Marie volunteered to spearhead this effort
- Required Reading List for new staff members
- Instituting Summer Fridays
- Program Directors &amp; Tim are meeting to finalize the orientation plan for the new PAs
- Tim ordering new business cards -- let him know if you need any
- Tim bringing in video camera for office to begin making Program Overview videos


**Featured Presentation **
Juliana presented on NYC Bike Week &amp; design competition for new bike racks.

**Adam H.:**

Advocacy stuff:
- Place + Displaced getting started in LIC, lead partner is Chocolate Factory Theater who are very interested in the project and will probably have more input than partner orgs did in Williamsburg.
- (with Marie) looking at doing health insurance bill in NY state(still really early)
- There’s another cultural districts bill (combo of tax incentives, artists housing, etc.) – will take a closer look at it.


California trip
- Was invited to participate in an advisory committee re: Bay Area cultural asset mapping at the Hewlett foundation last week. The meeting itself wasn’t too productive, but afterward he spoke with head program people at both Hewlett and Irvine re: PA Spaces in both SF and LA. They were very interested and we’re now looking at making these foundations lead partners (as opposed to local arts orgs).


What’s happening with the book club?'



- Do people still want to do this? (Yes.)
- Alex: It’s hard to find time to read one book per month on a schedule. This might be more valuable if the timeline was more open-ended.
- Emily: The book club doesn’t need to be that formal – even if everyone hasn’t read (or finished) the same book when it meets they could still attend and the topic alone would probably be useful/informative.
- Marie volunteered to organize the book club, also suggested that staff start using Goodreads to communicate about books they’re reading (rate, recommend, etc.).

Adam H. also wants to have a couple of books – The Goal and The Service Profit Chain - that are required reading for all FA employees. This will start with the new PA’s and retroactively include everyone else. He’ll order copies for the office and we’re all supposed to read them in the next six months. (This is separate from the book club!)

**Ask the E.D.:**

KnowledgeTree

- People seem to pretty much hate KnowledgeTree.
- Adam H. thinks that the process for getting everyone up to speed on KT isn’t working. When he was researching KT seemed like the easiest/most basic system for document management, but maybe it isn’t right for us?
- Dianne said that she’s trying to do really simple things in KT that shouldn’t be a problem – it’s frustrating and taking up a lot of time.
- Adam N. said he figured it out through trial and error, but acknowledged that it was frustrating and counter-intuitive.
- Adam H. asked that Dianne, Emily, Juliana, and Adam N. create a list of all the things they’re having a hard time doing in KT and he’ll show them how to do them more simply. If that doesn’t work he’ll look into using something other than KT.


Summer office hours
- Dianne and Adam N. asked if the staff should take alternate Fridays off during the summer (i.e., half the staff is in the office one week and the other half the next).
- Adam H. suggested we just close early on Fridays, which everyone agreed was just as good.
- Alex asked if we work full days on Friday could we trade that time for extra days off? (For example, if we work 3 full Fridays, we earn one extra personal day.)
- Adam H. was okay with this.
- So, from Memorial Day until Labor Day the office will close early. Since people have slightly different schedules just work 4 hours from whenever you get in (e.g., 9-1:00pm, 10-2:00pm).


**Tim:**


- The new PA’s – Kara and Avi – start on Monday 5/18. He’s going to work up a tentative schedule for re: orientation/training and put it in the wiki.
- Next Friday 5/14 we’ll be moving shelves, etc. around to accommodate the new workstation by the kitchen area. Emily will move to the candy desk, Kara will sit where the silver shelf is, and Avi will take Emily’s spot.
- To confirm: the PA’s will be generalists and provide support to all programs (including PA Spaces and Liability Insurance) but will probably spend the majority of their time on Fiscal Sponsorship and Health Care.
- Tim and the Program Directors are meeting Monday re: the new PA’s.
- Dianne asked if the PA’s should split all the work equally, or does it make sense to assign them specific things (e.g. processing health care payments)? Adam H. said he doesn’t have any problem with PA’s being responsible for specific tasks as long as the other person knows how to do it.
- New computers and phones are on the way. Tim asked if we need another scanner (nah) or if anyone needs new business cards (people will let him know).


**Dianne:**


- Fiscal Sponsorship Survey is still open and getting responses.
- Got back webcasts that her and Juliana created. Thinks it would be nice if we did short videos explaining all the programs. Also possibly video intros about ourselves for the staff bios page? She can organize this but needs help with equipment/editing. (Tim will bring in his camera. Alex is in charge of some sort of parody of the opening credits of “The Office”.)


**Emily:**


- Re: Office food and beverage - Office Depot has totally changed their food offerings. They now only have pretzels. What about other food? Tea?
- Dianne has a car and goes to Fairway pretty often. Wouldn’t mind picking up supplies.
- Adam H. suggested we try Amazon.com.
- Tim will give Emily a budget for this and we’ll go from there.


**Travel:**



- Adam N.: Went to Houston for Opera America conference – not that many people there, people that came up were familiar with FA and pretty enthused. Not sure if its worthwhile to go again. Next up: Pittsburgh at the end of May for Pennsylvania Presenters Conference. He’s been asked to speak generally about FA, may do something with the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council when he’s there.
- Dianne: Went to Boston and spoke at Mass Art, Emerson, and BU. Connecting with career center people was really valuable – they are interested in having someone from FA come back. Makes sense to go to multiple schools, otherwise not really worth it. Also went to Creative Chicago Expo and spoke at SAIC. Speaking at Opera America this month, then at CT Film Festival, then she and Juliana are going to National Network of Fiscal Sponsors meeting.
- Adam N.: Did blog posts for May and June about “where is FA going?” (June post goes up last week of May. ) The main banner is not here, doesn’t know what happened to it, thinks hotel people took it at last conference…
- Alex: We may need to tailor the banners to specific conferences to make it more specific (Liability Insurance) or we just need an updated general banner.
- Emily: Going to Dance/USA (plus Tim) June 3-7th. (She got scholarship!) Also going to Baltimore tomorrow to meet with people about “something liability-related.”
- Adam H: Generally re: travel, thinks that everyone who is traveling should write at least 1 blog post about the trip. (Since we’re national its important that people know we’re actually out in the field going to all these things.)
- Alex: Asked a question in her last blog post and got a lot of great responses. Recommends asking questions in posts, or for feedback.
- Adam H.: Thinks that in generally we need to be blogging more. (Maybe do post where we list all the new fiscal sponsorships that were approved.) His posts are more like essays – tend to be long – not necessarily for the majority of FA members. He’s counting on other staff to have their own voices and write about their own topics.
- Alex: Went to Staten Island and spoke at COAHSI workshop focusing on aging artists. She’s going to Pratt on Memorial Day weekend to speak about FA services. Said she doesn’t mind doing these things – if anyone has an event they’re invited to and can’t go let her know.
- Juliana: Going to NYC Grassroots Media Conference, will try and get one of the new PA’s to go with her.</field>

Notes by Natale.

Absent: Debicella

**Huttler Presentation:** Misnomer Dance Co.'s Audience Engagement Project

**Huttler **
**- Response to 360 Review:** Some people feel I should slow down when making decisions. Don't be afraid to ask questions when I'm doing this. I'll try to improve. In terms of feedback, some people felt that they've received good feedback, whereas others want more. It's never a problem to ask for feedback -- I'll be better about offering it. Program director check-ins... Are these useful? On one level, they are frequent, but we cancel them a lot. Would it be more useful to have a monthly meeting where we try NOT to cancel and that we reschedule if it needs to be postponed. (Response from staff was mixed... We could go either way.) Maybe we can do it on a per-person basis depending on what you want. Staff were sympathetic to the stress I face with web-related stuff, but were very frustrated when things blow up since it creates more work. Staff wants more web stuff delegated to Gemini. Huttler would love to give 80% to Gemini (there is some stuff he likes doing), but the problem is that it's harder than you think to pass it off to other people. Most of the code isn't documented and exists in my head. I'm trying to move in the direction of transferring everything over. It's not a &quot;flip the switch&quot; kind of thing. I'm optimistic that within the next year, we'll have some progress on that front. Comments about me zoning out during conversations. I'm aware this is a problem. Punch me in the nose when you see me doing this. Usually, I'm still taking in information, but sometimes I'm in Neverland thinking about something else that was triggered by your conversation. The other thing people mentioned was that I spend too much time working on Misnomer's Board while at work. I like and believe in their work, but I'm doing Misnomer's Board with my FA hat on because it gives us access and face time that I couldn't get otherwise (Ben Cameron, Rock Fdn, etc). It's the best face time since I'm not asking them for face time for FA. It's great for relationship-building. If I can succeed in getting AEP built on Ars Libera, it will add so much to Ars Libera. There are a lot of deep synergies between Misnomer and my work here. I will continue to do projects like this so that I'm seen as an expert in the field.


- Getting more interesting resumes from the Yale folks for internships. I want to give an intern something real since they aren't paid much, but that requires you provide a lot of supervision. The only way I think we can make it worthwhile is to get great people and give them a project that they can own completely. We just define deliverables. I'm putting two people, at least, on an Ars Libera project. Ticketing and maybe donor management. These interns would put together a needs assessment and functional spec. Talk to fundraising professionals, what they like about Raiser's Edge and Tessitura. The deliverable would be a spec that I can give to developers to build. I interviewed Devon Smith who I liked and I invited her to do this. We will pay about $10/hour. Devon might not be able to do it. I have another interview next week. This project can easily expand to meet the labor capacity available -- I'll take up to three people. I want grad students who are really smart and don't need to be handheld during the process. Need people who know a lot about the field. (Marie: Any way we can have a design intern?) I'm open to it, but my hesitation is that you need to have a long-term design person generally. Do you have someone in mind? (Marie: No, but I know people that can point us in the right direction.) The guy who was doing the Fractured U. work is a really great designer. He worked at an elite branding firm doing design work. His aesthetic is good for us. I'd like to give him one or two assignments. Justin has committed as an intern for 15-20 hours a week for 8 weeks or longer. He'll be working here in the office. Haven't set a start date yet.


**Lowbridge **

- Narrowed Program Associate search down to three candidates, who will meet with Huttler next week. It depends when they will start. Two out of three can't start until mid-May and one can start after giving two weeks notice. We didn't set a deadline -- we wanted to find the best person possible. We interviewed 15+ people out of 150+ submissions. We won't do more interviews. May 15th is the latest -- not ideal, but it is what it is. 
(Emily and Juliana: We need someone ASAP. We are staying very late, working from home, and not getting everything done. We might need two new people. It seems like something happened this week or last -- maybe NPR -- but the last three weeks have been overwhelming and we're starting to make minor mistakes because we're working so quickly. Call and email volume is huge. Healthcare and grant reviews have gone up. We walked out at 7PM with 17 unanswered voicemails. Checked things on vacation as well. We'll make it to 5/15, but it's hard.) Hiring a second person might be a possibility we can look into. (Huttler: It make might sense to get two people if we can. Let me look at the numbers and see if it's realistic. What percentage of the overwhelm factor falls in the category of admin work vs. content matter expertise/customer service.) (Emily: I have a fair amount of admin work that is admin work, but that takes time.) (Juliana: QB and other logging is a time suck, which I know will end soon since we will only have to log things in one place.) (Huttler: Because of uncertainty with healthcare and with some of the roll-out of automation software, I want to make sure this person would have enough to do.) (Staff: But we're blowing up and we'll need new people soon anyway.) (Emily: I'm under water with Liability Insurance and am caring more about the famous people applying, which isn't good.) (Huttler: Well let's see what we can do about hiring another person.) (Huttler: Alex, we should talk about making Community Members a good individual donor base and work on a campaign for this.) (Alex: Agreed.)


- Adam and I haven't talked about my managing director transition yet, but we will later today. April 16th is Tim's first day. More on this soon.


**Natale **
- Went to APASO. Great conference. Theatre Bay Area wants to do PA Spaces with us and has funders basically lined up for the project. (Staff: This will be great. San Francisco is a great place to start.)

- Talked to students at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Small, but good, as expected.

- Want to have a social media marketing strategy. How are we using Facebook, Twitter, etc? Want to make sure we use each in tandem and are sending the same message. (Huttler: Let's have a task force to develop this strategy. Let's leave Emily Bowles out of it for now. Who is interested?) (Marie, Kirsten, and Natale are especially interested. Others are also interested, but we will wait until Tim is here.)

- Went to Arts Advocacy Day. Spoke at an Emerging Leader Symposium at American University, which went well. Spoke to a legislative aide for Rep. Dan Maffei (D - Syracuse, NY) and got to meet the congressman as well. My friend is his chief of staff. Also went to a session on advocacy on healthcare and the arts, but it was mainly about using art in therapy. Very little dedicated to artist healthcare plans. Huttler is on some advisory group for this, which he doesn't like being on.


**Ortiz **
- Ceased enrollment for all NY plans. Those plans are probably going away anyway and we're attracting the wrong crowd (lots of over 50's, which isn't good for these plans). Looking at the healthcare plans on the whole, we want to look at what value we can bring and what niche market we can serve. We want to fill a need and do something no one else is doing. I see it as a way of bringing the HC program in line with everything else with what FA is doing. There are three strategies we are going to try:

---&gt; Although I've never wanted to do this before, we might try doing small group plans in NY for employers. We can't do this in other states, but laws might change. We would serve as the broker for this plan. Smallest group plan would be for two people. (Huttler: I bullied Marie into offering this. We have great brand recognition in NYC, that it would be easy to leverage this to get meetings with Managing Directors and convince them that we could serve them better than their current brokers. There could be synergies with the Liability Insurance program as well. Instead of having Marie talking to some crazy person over 50 for hours, she can spend 30 minutes on the phone with a managing director and they'll stay with us year after year.) (Lowbridge: What about the revenue structure?) (Huttler: The only incentive is that we're Fractured Atlas and it's a free service to help you with your plans.) We wouldn't deal with their employees, just the heads of the organization making the decisions. It's an HR thing for them. It saves us time. (Huttler: You would have to have actual employees to get these plans. If there is credibility to leverage, we can provide them with all of their insurance needs.) I'm worried about tracking renewals, but we can build it into the software spec.

---&gt; The second strategy is broker-service model. Advertising as a free service, but removing basic customer service (very specific questions about the plans). Aetna is willing to cut some of their marketing budget to do an awareness campaign. (Huttler: Aetna wants to do the customer service.) But, Aetna could start poaching our members. There is no way of calling customer service without calling sales first. (Huttler: We need to talk about that.) (Lowbridge: But the whole thing is that members are trained to call us with those questions.) There would be education surrounding the plans that Aetna would provide -- cool, hip, and targeted towards our main segment of members. All we're getting is people in CA who are over 50. I want to target our demographic. Make an education component so that there are no qualms about buying and that it winds up being just transactional. Drill down to the most important things about health insurance. Here are the things you need to know and here's how you can buy it. Building awareness that way so they can easily decipher differences between plans will make the process less time consuming. The people we want on these plans... they don't want to think about getting health insurance. So, we'll make it easy for them. But, Aetna won't be caught up on technology until 2011. So that makes this hard. (Huttler: But, we've gotten some clarity on this recently. Healthcare companies went to Congress and are now willing to do guaranteed issue plans if Congress does a government mandate requiring everyone to have insurance. This would be great for us and Congress was extremely interested, which is surprising, as people think it feels un-American. The healthcare companies proposed a riff on Hillary Clinton's campaign plan. It sort of makes sense.) But, we would need to see what this mandate would look like. The biggest hurdle would be getting over the fact that this is coming from the insurance companies and not from Congress itself.

---&gt; The third model focuses on education and advocacy, with some ad hoc recommendations of certain insurance plans. This would be through eHealthInsurance, which is great and takes like 15 minutes to get insurance through. We could become a part of their referral service and get $40 per app that's submitted through them. They take care of all customer service.

- All three strategies would go together. We would then be planting seeds for if the new administration changes things, we've built brand recognition and trust with our members and then they can come to us. We would be ready when and if we do have a plan again. (Huttler: We can dodge the &quot;why go through FA if they aren't cheaper&quot; by saying &quot;we offer a free service, here's what we do for you.&quot; Might not solve everything altogether, but it's a reframing.) I think people still want to know the added, tangible value. (Gray: It's &quot;go try doing this yourself.&quot;) We would schedule appointments with people. They fill out an intake form and then I sit down with them for 15 minutes and answer their questions. Program Associates can handle this. (Gray: This model drives home the value and I can get funding for it.) (Huttler: It's a major reframing that I feel really optimistic about.) And people won't call me three times a day. I'll only talk to them during the meeting. All three strategies will be tried in parallel. I like eHealthInsurance the best. These changes will roll out in the next three month.

- We need to meet about NY Health Foundation. We should just pin all of these things on HIP and their restructuring, price increase, and possibly going to drop us. (Gray: They know their shit. We have to make sure we know our message going in.) (Huttler: Have Marie and I on the call with you.)

**Watts **
- ShowBiz Expo was not especially interesting or exciting. Bob, Meghan, Cynthia (E&amp;O attorney who was awesome... she is an artist, too), Alex, and I. Fewer people there this time around. Bob felt good about it. I hated it. We need a new banner -- we don't do marketing or fundraising and that's what everyone asked about. Lots of people have called wanting us to buy ad space. We should only do it once per year, if that. We had three people sign up so far. Lots of annoying phone calls resulted from it. We'll probably do it in the spring. (Arwen: It's not our demographic.) I'll keep an eye on who signs up and if they do anything.</field>

		<field name="content">### March 2009


Staff in attendance: Adam H, Alex, Adam N, Arwen, Marie, Emily, Juliana, Kirsten

Alex presented on Christo and Jean Claude and the logistics of large-scale public art.

**Huttler: **

- purchased rugs for the West Wing which should be arriving shortly;
- updated us on the status of Ars Libera: the Mellon Foundation has given a soft commitment for funding for the fall, ticketing software will come first
- updated us on P&amp;D: he will be going to California to advise on a cultural mapping project in Silicon Valley, East Harlem is still in the running for the third neighborhood of P&amp;D
- the move to the document management system is in progress and the final move will happen soon
- discussion on the FA healthcare plan, flex spending accounts, possible switch to two plans pending more research, one that we currently have and possibly a high-deductible plan with an HSA

Lowbridge: 

- brought up the possible need for a conference room schedule: from here on it will be done through Zimbra's calendar with conference@fracturedatlas.org
- we currently have 28 applications for the Program Associate position and will begin calling people the week of March 9 for interviews
- attending an event for Yale School of Management to search for an intern and an NYU event to talk about general FA things on Saturday
- alerted us that quarterly budget reports will be out the week of March 9
- discussed a &quot;wiki sprint&quot; where we all spend time together updating and standardizing the wiki
- facilitated a discussion on the possibility of an &quot;FAQ sprint&quot; as well

**Gray:** 

- explained the upcoming cultivation event on March 12, asked that FA staff try to attend and bring friends

**Natale: **

- facilitated a discussion on potential changes to the development grants: final decision appears to be to combine into one program and rename &quot;micro grants&quot; but keep funding options broad. In addition the grants committee may have some changes made to it as well as a discussion to clarify exactly what they are looking to fund
- announced new Open Arts Network partners: New York Women in Film and Television, Pittsburgh Arts Council
- described his experience attending a Savannah College of Art and Design career fair and commented that career fairs are probably not good uses of staff time but events specifically targeted to giving information to students might be more useful
- updated us on the progress of Fractured U: the software development is progressing and Kamal is working with instructors to develop classes
- facilitated a discussion with Lowbridge regarding the most recent LA trip to let us know that it was quite successful; the next trip is being planned for April or May to focus on dance and music
- provided us with the results of the annual member survey in which many things remained the same, including the tendency to think of us as being smart but slow and too New York-centric. The possibility of including program-specific questions in the survey was discussed and generally agreed upon as well as the potential for deploying uservoice for comments and piloting programs outside of NYC; some edits to the healthcare portion of the website to minimize the focus on New York were discussed.

**Watts: **

- described the two new liability programs that will be launched shortly: fine art coverage and travel accident insurance
- discussed the upcoming Showbiz Expo and facilitated a discussion as to whether it is worth our time: the decision was that we will do it again this time with some small changes and see if we can track the efficacy in order to more accurately determine the impact of the event

**Nordine: **

- informed us of the progress of the Musician's Residency competition that is being conducted: a meeting will be held Wednesday to review submissions and select the recipients
- NYCPAS will shortly be sending out their annual survey to the spaces included in the database to ensure the accuracy of their information</field>

- facilitated a discussion in response to the RFC about a University Affiliate program – resolved that Adam N will develop strategies, goals &amp; funding ideas to present for consideration &amp; further discussion; 
- facilitated a discussion about Community members being eligible for our grants program – resolved that ALL members should have access and to control the floodgates &amp; quality, we will begin charging a nominal $10 application fee to any applicant regardless of membership level

**Gray: **


- updated on the results of the donor survey (10% response rate – they love the newsletter &amp; events); 
- requested suggestions for artists to feature at 2009 cultivation events and for topics/speakers to focus the 2009 issue breakfasts around – suggestions should be sent to her directly.

**Staff meeting 1/7/2010**

In attendance: Tim, Justin, Adam, Marie, Dianne, Kirsten, Natale, Alex, Rafael, Juliana, Kara, Emily, Ian

**PD budget reports:** Tim explained the rationale behind the budgeting for those who were not involved. Add up totals for current fiscal year and compare to previous year's budget. FY10 was the second year of doing actual program budgets broken out. On expenses, both direct and indirect listed. Direct is direct. Indirect calculated based on percentages; we have no direct control over that as it is based on overall average of all of our time. October Board meeting approved this year's budget.

Pizza break. Tim allowed 2 minutes. 12:19pm descend on pizza. 12:25 restart meeting with pizza in hand.

**Adam:** PD and OAN; got money swept from FS for micro grants. $2800 from visa advisories. $8400 from investments. FU enrollees, 250-300 enrollees in quarter. Everything was still free at that time. Paid courses now live. PD expenses: professional fees for Kamal, Zeke (designer). Targeted visa program for some TLC as easy money. OAN: no real income except grants, thanks NEA. Expenses are for travel, ramping up marketing and communications with OAN partners but not reflected yet. Associate members make up about 31% of our total membership.

**Dianne: FS:** 1700 projects in program, approved 286 in first quarter. 60-80 projects apply per month. Guesses that we increase by 100 projects per quarter with attrition. Est $4,300,000 for year, received 29% of that in first quarter. Last year about $3.5 million raised. Have released 26% as of now. On track for now to meet projected goals.

**Emily:** we have a good surplus (much more than originally planned in the budget) and are selling more policies.

**Marie: **membership dues at 50%, thanks to Adam and Tim for sharing membership dues with HC since most people sign up for free. Dues and subscriptions: pays for Health Advocate access for members who are enrolled in full featured HIP plans. At 2% of deficit after first quarter. NY Emblem plans 160 enrollees; HIP 250 enrollees but that will go down, not up; Aetna 50-60 enrollments.

**Justin:** ATHENA hasn't spent much money on anything but Justin and Adam. Grant is being released in pieces; $300,000 remaining from Mellon will come when they approve the draft of a plan. Posted job offers for two Java developers for the work. Developers will be in-house staff and not contracted out. Parts will still be contracted. Started two mailing lists that Justin will send info out on so that we can join. Launching new website today as well. First part of planning process done by end of February, identify users, make user cases and user stories for how they will interact with system. Developers will start at end of February and at that point tech specs will be developed. Board will vote on DC office on Saturday.

**Kirsten:** PA spaces and NYCPAS. PA spaces on track. NYCPAS on track. Website advertising a little low, Kirsten trying to increase that somehow. Mellon dance study getting and spending revenue.

**Alex:** Restricted reflects spent not received; more money coming in from Eugenie and Horace for NYCPAS that will arrive in Q2. Some things are high, some things are low for various reasons.

**Adam Huttler:** whatever he has plus “Ask the ED”. Board meeting Saturday, presenting at APAP Saturday morning, Ian and Huttler meeting with Hewlett in SF for BACAM next week, Missouri State University Public Affairs Conference in a few months, delivering keynote speech. MSU, part of public affairs program. “New models” speech. Meeting with Chair of NEA from Reagan era this afternoon. Adam's chair is slowly but steadily breaking. Frank Hodson (?) now at State Department and leading initiative to facilitate better data collection and tracking re: artists performing abroad. How to aggregate and present information about US artists performing abroad already and how to increase US cultural diplomacy. May be a technology component to this but Adam will help him see the light. Possible consulting gig for FA?

**Jungle Disk:** we have an open HD ticket with them, Justin has not received an awesome response. He and Huttler have discussed possible other options including windows share instead of jungle disk.

Kudos to Justin for saving our phones yesterday after Tim broke them. Tim attempted to deflect blame onto Ian.

**
Tim:** 360 reviews schedule. Amy has list of people to review/be reviewed. She should be contacting us shortly. Adam reminded us that it's best to be honest and direct.

W2s should be coming shortly. 1099 will be done this week (hopefully) and we'll get a PDF of them directly. Monday Marie and Alex leading ice cream social/branding session. There may not actually be ice cream.

Diversity task force being chaired by Alex. If you're interested in participating let her know. Michelle sent comments on our session over to Tim, including recommendations, which he shared with Adam and Alex. Michelle also forwarded two books for our possible use.

**Where have you been, where are you going:** Adam is going to Phoenix next week for emerging leader council; Ian got elected to the council so congrats. Adam renewed for another three years but is only intending to stay on for one year. He considers him to be an emerging rockstar rather than an emerging leader. 17-ish member council. They use their emerging leader powers to influence AFTA. Adam will also go to Drexel in Philly the following week for College of Arts. Justin is going to Toronto for Intix supposed to be international ticketing conference but may be more North American. Next week will be at Ticket Summit in NYC for brokers, group sales agents etc. Justin began a drinking group named BAIG by Juliana. First meeting January 20 at Fette Sau. Ian will be in CA for Hewlitt and Arts Visioning conference in Sacramento. Good time to meet with CA people and Hewlitt people, in theory.</field>

Start: 12:14PM

TIM

- Looking at 10th floor space, seeing if we can make it work - No presentation today, but hoping to rediscuss what these should be

HUTTLER

- Lots of time on ATHENA and helping Justin with hiring - Helping Tim with 10th floor situation - Kresge grant app has been sent off - Dianne: Wondering if anyone recorded your Yale presentation? No. - Doing presentation at University of Missouri. Might do white paper on it for Mellon. - - Topic: New models for non-profit cultural sector.

TIM

- Amy had her baby, Oliver, so 360s will be delayed a bit, but please send them off ASAP - 2/15 is off for President’s Day - Sarah Urbanek from Yale SOM is starting as our new intern on Monday – working on BACAM with Ian, possibly working with Mellon white paper, and help with overall FA marketing (but may scale this back a bit) - Working on setting up doing ACH for paying healthcare premiums. - Everyone has done at least one staff meeting presentation so far, except Tim, Justin, and Ian. Would it make sense if we instead practiced sessions that we’re planning on doing in the field? Dianne thinks these would be way too long. Huttler agrees and says that these were supposed to not be about Fractured Atlas. Generally most agree with this statement. Though some say it might help as practice. Justin will present in March.

ALEX

- Diversity Committee: First meeting was Tim, Marie, Kara, Alex. Figuring out what it would take for FA to pursue diversity goals. Mainly a discussion group that reports to the larger group. Discussed perception of community re: FA. We could be doing a better job reaching out to communities on a number of levels. We might attend events by discipline or community-specific orgs. We may ask for feedback from everyone in the near future re: perception of FA. Will be meeting week prior to staff meetings. Feel free to send thoughts then. Anything is game for conversation.

MARIE

- Because Art is Dangerous campaign didn’t work out to anyone’s expectations. It was an experiment though and we learned from it. We’re exploring other options. We’re going to beef up HC content on website. Might look at other campaigns in the future.

EMILY

- Working on “pocket guides” for insurance. Want to beef up content/education on website but wanted marketing pieces as well. First one is 16 pages on insurance for dancers/dance companies. Like a choose your own adventure. Zeke is creating them for us and is also creating them as websites. They have photos in them – lightly designed. Might want to improve upon the design in the future. We can print them on demand. Marie will be doing an HC and an HSA one. Not really sales pieces. Rolling these out every two weeks. Maybe we can consider using Dave or Bambang to design parts of these.

NATALE

- Talked about OAN revamp. We are getting memberships to most of our OAN partners for FA and are reconnecting with them over the phone, then by quarterly communications. - Discussed how courses could be promoted within FA. We might send direct emails to members who use FS and/or LI. Suggestion on having 1 minute previews of workshops on overview page.

KIRSTEN

- Accepting applications now for composer residencies. - Greater Philadelphia Space Finder – collecting data now, working on software soon. They are partnering with the Theatre Alliance, Dance/USA Philadelphia, and the Philadelphia Music Project. Should launch late spring/early summer.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN/WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

- Huttler &amp; Tim having 2nd meeting with Philly council on Wednesday 2/10. - Huttler &amp; Ian going to meet with NEA (Rocco) next week re: cultural asset maps. - Emily was in Denver for a public art conference. - Dianne &amp; Alex doing a presentation for Laura Braslow (Arts in Bushwick). - Justin went to inTix conference &amp; Ticket Summit conference. - Emily &amp; Justin doing Winter Dance Forum for Dance/NYC. - Emily doing a workshop for ABC with a lawyer re: Worker’s Comp. - Ian &amp; Huttler went to San Fran.

(Pretty much everyone was in attendance and there were no pranks.)


**Quarterly budget reports**

Tim reminded everyone that each quarter carries less weight than the one before it for membership dues. We’re doing well on investment income due to the fact that we budgeted very conservatively. There is a 433% surplus right now (end of Q2).


**Adam Natale:**

Professional Development
- Hopefully revenue will increase, we’re sending out more letters to immigration attorneys.

Open Arts Network
- No earned revenue for this program, but we did receive $20K from the NEA. Expenses are just travel and payroll.


**Dianne/Fiscal Sponsorship:**



- We’re on target for the money released this quarter.
- Slightly behind on direct fees (rush fees, consultations, etc.)
- On target for the amount of money that projects are supposed to be earning.
- (At this point there was a question about the point of the budget reports. Adam Huttler suggested that we use more of a narrative for the budget reports. What do the numbers mean about the health of the program? The point of the budget reports is for the Program Directors to have greater conceptual responsibility for their own areas and a better understanding of how FA’s finances work as a whole. Justin said it would be helpful to have a breakdown of variable expenses. Tim and Adam said that was doable with advance notice.)


**Emily/Liability Insurance:**


- Number of policies sold is right on track. The money coming in from binder fees is down in Q2; many members buying policies are actually renewing and are paying a lower binder fee. Still ahead of schedule – at 62% right now, expects to come in around 110% overall.
- We will be launching 2 or 3 new programs in the next quarter which may impact the numbers (no new programs added in Q2).
- Not sure how many more targeted audience groups we’ll find, so growth will probably be about volume and hopefully larger policies (less about adding new programs).
- New programs are Instrument Insurance, Craft Artists, and Technicians.
- Pocket guide site was launched yesterday: http://www.arts-insurance.info
- Not every guide will be printed, we’ll do it on an as-needed basis (half of the dance guides have been given away so far!)
- Purpose of pocket guides is two-fold: educational &amp; marketing.
- Insurance business cards with the new website have been made.

**
Dianne/Fiscal Sponsorship (cont.)**



- We’ve signed an agreement with IndieGoGo to allow our members to raise money for their projects through the site. (Won’t look like our donation page, but the money will come directly to us.) We’re going to test this for a year and see if it brings in any new projects (IndieGoGo currently has 2400 projects on their site. Also talked to Kickstarter but they’re not interesting in partnering with us right now.
- We’re about to start allowing projects to accept partially deductible donations by credit card. They’ll actually be able to create giving levels and an entire campaign (we’ll develop more functionality down the road). There has been a huge demand for this.
- There will be a webinar info session in a couple of weeks. It will be recorded and maybe posted. The plan is to do two different info sessions – one for projects that are already in the program and one for projects that are interested in joining.


**Justin/ATHENA:**

- We’re hiring 2 ATHENA employees (both Java developers). Gary Moore will start in April and work in Justin’s office (he’s moving here to take the job!). Finn lives in Ireland and will remain there and work as a contractor. (Finn and Justin have worked together before.)


Marie/Health Insurance:



- Income for dues for health insurance went up a little bit. Increased new enrollments since December. More enrollments than we’ve ever had before and not as many terminations (only 1-2/month).
- HIP plan went up almost $100 – now our lowest HIP plan is close to $500. Hopefully some of the members will switch to Emblem Health plans (those will go up in September, but hopefully not as much).
- Currently we have 193 enrolled in HIP, 198 in Emblem Health, 50 with AETNA.


Ian/BACAM:



- The budget is really dictated by the Hewlett contract. Mostly on target. Lots of travel expenses to go to California.
- Next trip in June we’ll be presenting progress report to Hewlett.


**Kirsten/PA Spaces:**



- A lot of what we’re currently working on is actually in the BACAM budget.
- “PA Spaces” budget is really only Philadelphia, not much happening.
- NYCPAS budget is musicians’ residencies, Mellon Study, a lot of contract labor (David J. and Emily B.), this probably won’t continue into FY11.


**Adam Huttler:**

- Creative Economy Workspace Initiative – it’s a bad budget year but Adam’s optimistic that we’ll get something for this proposal.


**Alex: **

- $50K in senate money, maybe assembly money, DCA money in next Q and the rest of the Mellon money.
- Kresge grant contract begins in April?
- NEA award letter came today and our amount went up.
- Bonus Status Report: Tim reported that our bonus status for the year looks like about 10.5% right now (last year was 8%). Adam H. suggested that we may want to revisit this formula based on some of the new ways we’re tracking things.

**Ask the E.D.:**


- Tomorrow at the Board meeting Adam is presenting his plan for the $750K Kresge grant:
- The grant does require us to create two new spaces modules (visual arts and film) plus bring the existing PA Spaces module to 4 new cities. This accounts for roughly $125K
- Some of the money will go to an additional hire for ATHENA. This person will focus on user interface and design.
- We’re also interviewing PHP programmers now. This person (or maybe we’ll use a few different contractors at first) will address the backlog of work that needs to be done. Adam won’t initially put them on anything that touches money. They’ll be working on the Calendar of Events, “My Stuff”, and the Liability Insurance policy status tracking.
- The Development/Marketing Specialist willwork closely with Alex and Tim on development administration, social media management, etc. This will be a full-time position, and they’re open to inside hires. Target is for the person to start in June.
- This leaves around $150K, which Adam is viewing as marketing/outreach R &amp; D budget. The idea is to try some experiments – maybe advertising?
- Ticketmaster and Livenation merger – the Justice Dept. has been going to the Future of Music Coalition for advice on various aspects of how this merger might affect the field. FMC asked Adam to participate in an educational campaign for the field on their rights re: the consent decree and how to spot violations. Hopefully this will get us on the radars of music people and get us noticed more in DC.
- 


**New office info/updates:**



- There’s a punch list for all the things that are still not working in the office, let Tim know if you see anything that looks “weird.”
- Tim and Justin are working on the 215 ext. problem.
- Still trying to figure out what’s happening with the front desk. The doorbell works and Tim and Justin are installing a motion sensor so we can hear when people enter the office.
- The 10th floor is a reentry floor and that door will always be unlocked, so make sure you lock the actual doors to the office.
- All keycards now work at front and back doors.
- Justin asks us to turn our computers off ALL THE WAY. Try plugging your phone into an outlet other than your power strip and turning your power strip off when you leave the office for the evening.
- Tim suggested people pay closer attention to their IM statuses so people know where you are.
- We’ll start using the 888-692-7878 # as a contact for members. It’s less NYC-centric.


**Upcoming/past events:**

- Board meeting tomorrow morning.
- Also tomorrow, 12 arts orgs from around the world meeting with LINC, then with FA.
- Place and Displaced event on April 24 in Long Island City (Irish Cultural Center). We’ll hopefully be streaming the panel discussion.
- Dianne did an info session in Providence. Wasn’t very well attended but she met a few people there who were excited about Fractured Atlas. She also did info session in Boston which was great. Upcoming info session at the Bushwick Starr on April 27th.
- Adams Hutter and Natale both went to APASO. It’s going to be in Austin next year and they’re trying to schedule it so it’s right around SXSW.
- Emily went to an arts and education conference in Albany.
- Alex and Marie are speaking to the Negro Ensemble Company this Sat. about FA programs.
- Emily and Dianne are going to be at the Creative Chicago Expo next week
- Emily will be at the LA Showbiz Expo with Bob later in April.
- Natale is going to Richmond and DC.

**Impact Study**

Interested in conducting an impact study as a way of more formally and rigorously measuring what we do. This would include gathering both quantitative and qualitative data on ROI. Most the nonprofit sector, particularly the arts, has not really caught on to it. It’s difficult to measure more intrinsic impact but there are some in the field already paving the way in this respect with success, like Alan Brown in the Bay Area.

An impact study would be much easier for an organization like Fractured Atlas to conduct since we more closely resemble a social service organization.

The Doris Duke Foundation is a good candidate as a source of funding through their Arts Innovation Program. That program focuses on funding half baked ideas that are new, different, and risky, which could have an impact on the organization and the field.

It would be interesting to find out who Fractured Atlas is serving, or not, and what may be the underlying causes. Most organizations would be scared to find out that they are not making as much as an impact they think they are, but Fractured Atlas must be open to that possibility. This, in turn, would inform future program development. It may be interesting to learn of other impacts we make on the field that we may not be aware of and how our work affects the quantity and quality of art in America.

This type of study would be useful in how a service organization thinks about their programs across the board.

**Subletting 2 spaces in the office**



- $1,000 per month, per space with a 3 month minimum
- Spaces are set up to be “plug and play.&quot;


**Last one in the office**



- Turn off lights and air conditioner.
- Check all doors are locked.
- Check restroom in back doorway is locked.

**Budget**



- Still in the works with a 6/1 deadline.
- New open positions @ Fractured Atlas

**Development Marketing Specialist**


- 1st Round of interviews done
- Individuals have until 5/15 to submit for the opening
- Hope to have someone in the office by 6/15

**Admin. Assistant Positions**



- 2 openings at 20 hrs/week w/no benefits or vacation time
- 10am-2pm and 2pm-6pm shift

**Research Interns
**


- 4 openings with 2 individuals assigned per project
- 8-12 weeks at 20hrs/week


**Bookkeeping for Fractured Atlas**

- Bringing in Jillian Hall for 8 hrs/week


**360 Reviews**



- This time around, the reviews didn’t seem to in a format that proved to be as constructive.
- Fractured Atlas may need to explore other models of evaluation that fit in with a growing staff


**Board Meeting Attendance**



- Program Director Presentation- Both staff and board enjoy opportunity for interaction.
- Staff attendance to the board meeting should be limited to presenters. Otherwise, it might turn into a staff meeting with the board sitting in.


**Alex Fun Run**


- Run/walk 3K event on 6/24 hosted by the American Heart Association
- Staff and Fractured Atlas extended family can sign up in teams or as individuals
- Add Café Press under Community on the Website


**Donor File &amp; Wiki Sprints**

- Pull list of duplicate folders in active Customer Folders
- Go through the legacy files with donors with one single PDF receipt. Delete the folders and then see what’s left for migration.
- Re: wiki. Must map and outline it differently before embarking on a sprint


**Letter head Doc**

- There’s a set style Fractured Atlas has in terms of font, spacing, formatting, etc. The current doc with the style already pre-set is located in the Marketing folder.

**In FS world**

- Building functionality for projects to have fundraising campaign. This would include being able to set a goal with ability to add pics/videos making it compatible with social media tools. Also, the ability to accept partially deductible gifts.
- Indiegogo is launching in June. It’s a similar tool, but it’s a way that projects can start having access to this functionality, until FA builds its own platform.
- 1st webinar occurred last month with 30 participants. Hope to have different variations, ie. FS Orientation and Fundraising
- Would like one webinar to be transcribed, recorded, and archived.


**Ustream**



- Used Ustream for a Placed + Displaced event. Simple technology
- During DanceUSA conference, Tim and Sydney Skybetter plan on using Ustream from the hotel room and engage in talks about relevant issues in the field. Sky/Nova:15 will air on http://ustream.tv/channel/skynova15


**Where have you been and where are you going?**

July 1 Staff meeting


Lunch: pizza!


**Presentation by Gary on wine.** Unfortunately, there were no samples. Introduction of FA wine tasting club.


**Adam Huttler/Ask the ED July Monthly meeting:** he’ll be somewhat available while he’s on vacation. Program directors will meet with Tim, and Adam can call in on as-needed basis. Adam probably more available in the morning while on vacation.


Gemini SBS Relationship: Outside people have distorted view of what the FA/Gemini relationship is. Here’s the low-down: Gemini was a wholey owned sub of FA in 2003 for being a broker for HC, and to do software devel for other nonprofits and govt orgs. In 2007, FA sold 60% of stake in Gemini, only holds 40% now. Gemini employees hold other 60% now. Mostly software development now. Gemini budget is $500,000 while FA is approaching $7 million. We pay full price for work we contract from them. Gemini is very insignificant source of revenue for FA, maybe $100,000 in revenue. They do not contribute to FA. FA is share holder and nonprofits can legally own stake in for profits. Huttler owns 20%, Shawn and Dan own 20% each as well. Adam may be the only conflict of interest issue, so he runs big projects past board first. Some funders don’t want grant money to go to Gemini since Huttler is part owner, some funders don’t mind. Justin and ATHENA are completely unrelated to Gemini. For RFPs, moving forward Gemini will probably not be allowed to bid, Justin will decide about software development.


Latest on Future of Music: Ticketmaster/LiveNation merger; since Justice Department decided not to sue to block the merger. They made a deal with Ticket/Nation that they agree to 5 conditions to mitigate risk of anticompetitive nature. Future of Music Coalition (FMC) was brought in to provide oversight and enforcement on the 5 conditions. FA brought in by Future of Music because of expertise on ticketing. We are advising Justice Department on ticketing, also creating consumer guide to this merger and what it means. Also working with FMC on healthcare reform (mostly just high level talks) and also cultural policy coalition in DC is being batteded around. Michael Bracey is DC lobbyist and may be hired by us to do federal lobbying. We are kicking Ticketmaster in the chins since Justice Department can’t sue over merger. We are still not announcing this to the general public.


Board Meeting is July 23rd – If you owe Adam H anything for meeting, please get it done by JULY 12. Emily will be asked to present at that board meeting.


**Tim Cynova: **Tim may be out while Adam is out, so check requests need to be worked out in advance.

WELCOME Tiffany and Fintan! Fintan is Skyped in.

August 5 Staff meeting

Rafael presented on contemporary art museums and obsolete industry: a pretty casual survey

**Adam Hutt – **ask ED Adam discussed feelings in the office regarding his stronger interest in tech projects, rather than old tried and true programs. Wants to make sure that everyone knows this is not the case. Praised PD’s of FS, Healthcare, Liability, and Natale for working in trenches on program stuff. It’s not that he doesn’t have the same interest in older programs, it’s that there is more risk in new programs and a high potential for reward in big entrepreneur things – and he’s most needed and useful in the tech projects whereas older program staff members are grade A top meat and don’t need as much of his guidance cause they know their stuff.

Hired lobbyist firm Michael Bracey (associated with Future of Music Coalition – ED)? – for one year. Hoping it will open opportunities for funding, govn. agency connections, organizations that we otherwise couldn’t reach in DC.

Lobbying in NYC and NYS has until now mainly focused on discretionary funding. ROI has not been great, took a step back to reassess strategy – looking to identify policy pieces that can affect positive change for our constituents in city and state. Help us get better at organizing and looking at ways to use community organizing around policy piece as marketing.

**Tim –** staffing -	Welcome new staff- Max 10-2, Tara 2-6pm -	Athena rails/ui search – Justin and Adam working on ATHENA RAILS interface person – no luck yet -	Fall internships – looking for fall interns, Elena might do a bit of work from Boston, CJ and Selena will be heading out -	Days off definition (sick, vacation, personal) work from home – definitions in wiki. -	New health insurance options – looking outside of emblem health for options – premiums are way too high. New options will be available next week.

**New Business -**	Tech and FS – Dianne

**Cam update – **Ian Scouting out other areas of country that would be interested in having a cultural asset map. Spaces expansion could be used to help push forward asset map in other cities. BACAM – completed creating software from scratch. Working on next step for fundraising and ?? modules. Hewlett is on board for investing in this program in the next year = phase 2.

**ATHENA update – **Justin More community design sessions – one in SF just happened, one in Minneapolis coming up. Lots of orgs want ticketing – focusing on this now. Scope creep, much larger than initially planned. First release should be on track. Looking to possibly outsource artfully development, although they’d prefer someone in office. Gut punch from NY philharmonic who wanted to talk about open source ticketing system they just developed. They’ve gotten their own programmers to build on top of SUGAR – half private/half open source – claim to have developed a full feature ticketing system. Not available for community to download or use. They’ve applied open source licenses to all of the code, but it’s not publicly available. They have really smart, experienced managers to think about and experiment with new ideas for ticketing an d fundraising or whatever. We can be a channel for ideas and best practices to the level of our membership. If we can learn dynamic pricing best practices from them, our constituents could benefit from this. We’ve adopted approach to allow everyone to see and download code along the way. We are copyright holder.

**PA Spaces Update –** Kirsten Full complete space finder in Philly that’s live – it’s bright and vivid. Won’t publicly launch until there is enough spaces in it. Maybe late September. Bay area mid-November - possible launch. NYC with reservation system is spring. Moving ahead with LA and DC in spring.

**Aetna campaign/monthly e-news – **Tiffany Aetna is giving more money for campaign $20K – that features our members and advance org as whole. Campaign will feature 4-10 members, print, online, pocket guides. Monthly e-newsletter to launch 3rd week of august. It will be 4 links to external articles, not about us. And 3 or 4 of blog posts. Content types: development/sponsorship, big ideas (rant of the month), the big idea – cultural policy, geek alert – anything to do with tech. 15th of the month will be press release each month.

**Marie – **national HC State navigators, need to apply, looking for associations, organizations, brokers – could have access to funding to help them shop their options through state exchanges. Not until 2014 – online portal for shopping for health insurance through different carriers, categorize them so they are led into right paths – hopefully we’ll function as middle man – helping them navigate the system.

**Where have you been, where ya going? Updates?** People should be setting up meetings to plan ahead so you can set up meetings with others.

September 2nd Staff Meeting

**Ian presented on BACAM:** Looking good! Launching on Dec 1st… or else. Talk of adding a Fiscally Sponsored Project “layer” to the map.


**Adam Huttler:**

- Misnomer / AEP Update: Huttler is no longer on the Misnomer board. AEP status is unknown, as Huttler is no longer affiliated. Some concern that there may be some conflation of FA’s own tech projects with AEP &amp; Misnomer. This remains to be seen.

- Arts Ready: Lead by South Arts, funded by a Mellon Grant to collaborate with UC Berkeley on a disaster preparedness program for the arts. ATHENA has been selected to work on the project after responding to an RFP. This would be the first wholly externally-based ATHENA application.

- Ask the ED: Nothing!


**Tim Cynova:**

- Closed on Labor Day. The end of Summer Fridays, please submit tallies of Summer Fridays to Tim by Tuesday.

- New Fiscal Year. Raises for Salaried employees by 9/15. - LINC will be using our conference room on 9/27 and 9/28 for a Grant meeting, just a heads-up.


**Kirsten:**

- New Business: - NYCPA Spaces is, as of 9/1 is now fully part of FA. Tiffany is coordinating with Emily about the blog posts moving forward.

- Moving forward, the most appropriate and convenient name for the project will be, simply, “Spaces”.

- As the new site develops, Kirsten will no longer be the sole person who questions about the program come to, as Kirsten’s official new title is now Technology Project Manager, will be working on ATHENA and ticketing projects, helping to bridge gap between BACAM and ATHENA.


**Adam Natale:**

- New Business: - The Experts Network: establishing a database of arts consultants and coaches. Still developing the shape of the program, revenue model. Holding focus groups to establish viability of the project. Has some money from the Matisse foundation to explore the project.


**Dianne:**

- New Business - Will be attending YAMNY (Yale Alumni Association of Metro New York) meeting later this month, will be streamed via U-Stream.

- Starting up FS Webinars this month: four different webinars, each once a week. Introduction to FS, Orientation for new FS projects, Introduction to Fundraising, and Grants. Hopefully recording to upload onto Fractured U.


**Tiffany:**

- New Business: - Cultureflash, our new e-blast. About 21,000 members so far and growing. We’re pulling part of the content from our blog, and partially news from the field. Cultureblast will go out the 3rd week of the month (press releases go out the second week).


**Emily:**

- New Business: - Volunteer Accident, Equipment, and Travel Accident Liability policies are now automated on the new website.

- Still working on a Disability program, looking for a way to include Dancers. Brings up whether or not FA is in a position to advocate for Dancers and other artists with insurance companies.


**Marie – News:**

- A new NY State law granting the state dept of insurance more power, giving the dept the power to approve (or decline) new rates submitted by the insurance companies in NY. HIP / Emblem is finding new rates for all plans renewing between Jan-June. This means that they have an opportunity to contact the state department to give their feedback on the new rates.


**Where have you been? / Where are you going?**

- Alternative ROOTS in North Carolina (Emily). FA got a great response!
- Minnesota (Natalie / Justin): Found the theater organizations more interested in simple functionality of ticketing software, rather than marketing functions. Justin sees real possibility for our tech projects to have a greater presence in the area. While in MN, Natalie heard requests for future sessions in other locations. Got very positive feedback on the Public Art insurance program. Found that doing some research ahead of a visit would be very helpful, to get a clearer sense of the community being engaged. Discipline, ethnicity, region all play a large role in guiding the discussions. Being a NY based organization, it seems important to remain cognizant of the public perceptions of NYC in other parts of the country, and to relay the identities of FA as coming form a number of diverse locations and disciplines around the country.

- Dianne or possibly Emily going to Providence - Kirsten, Ian and Huttler going to California 9/20-22 - Justin going to Atlanta for South Arts - Natalie is going to various points in Maine in October - Kirsten and Tim going to Philadelphia - Tiffany going to Cleveland

**Tim:**


- Employee handbooks due a couple of minutes ago. All remaining due after the meeting is done.
- Handbook will be re-circulated at end of fiscal year
- New meeting format: 90 minutes (trying for 60) because no presentation


**Adam:**
- We are in a gauntlet (everyone is feeling it). Important to remember that we need to be there for each other. Important to take care of yourself. We'll get there and then there will be something else. Don't let the bastards get you down.

**ASK ED:**


- Emily: what's happening with NPR, CPB, etc. Adam: been quiet for the last few weeks. He hasn't heard anything (Christmas quiet). Ball is in NPR's court. They are still figuring out their strategy.
- Ian: saw that we have reciprocal office space deal with FMC.
- Natale: where is their office in DC? Adam: 1516 L St. NW in DC (downtown)
- Ian: what about the older talk of &quot;more substantive conversations&quot;. Adam: Not much. FA is still working with Michael Bracy (their founder), who is our federal lobbiest.
- Alex: is there anything else we need to do relative to the conference room accordingly. Adam, Tim: nothing. It goes in the non-FA conference calendar.
- Tiffany: what's up with 1% for culture? Adam: Not much. First meeting was in December at Central Park Zoo. Question is how formal it is going to be. Right now part of WCS, but every acknowledges this is not ideal. FiscSpo has been offered. A fiscal impact report is now being done as well. Existing report from Alliance for the Arts was not great. A new report needs to be made.
- Natale: I am a manhattan borough rep for 1%. We haven't met yet.
- Ian: We often ask about advocacy. Can we just make this a regular part of Ask the ED? Adam: Sure, but I'm not sure I will be any more organized regarding this.
- Ian: So what's up? Adam: Conference call with Dan Lurie forthcoming. Heather Ruth (FA fellow) is being pulled on for more hours to do some advocacy work. Plan is to create a full-time advocacy fellow position if we can afford it.

**Tim:**
Staffing:
   Still hiring additional admin assistant. About 1 mo. behind. Should be ready by Feb 1, when Kara moves to Specialist.
   Adding a new employee, Ian Guffy. Internal systems developer.
Justin:
   Ian is a junior developer who will be working on internal stuff. Will be under Gary. Tech Programs team will take over all internal development as well. We will work out how this works. Ian will sit with Gary.

**New Business:**
**Dianne - **Customer Service Analytics. We are going to start gather customer service analytics. We will be tagging help desk tickets and logging phone calls. Emily, Marie and Dianne will be the only person making tags. They will try to tag all tickets before assigning them. But, be sure to make sure tickets have tags before being closed. Emily, Marie, Dianne and Natale will meet to talk about tags. Purpose is to determine how much more staff is needed and figure out how much support from the programs people will need. People will start having to log phone calls. Process for logging phone calls. If you have a ticket related to a call, reply to that ticket but do not select an email address. Log duration of call, who you spoke to and brief note about what you talked about. If relevant to another staff member, include specific relevant things. If it is a new topic, create a new ticket. Can't do notes because you can't tag notes. Need to be able to tag notes or have a way to log calls.

Adam - Functionality doesn't exist.
[discussion ensues]

Outcome: tag helpdesk tickets, don't log phone calls until functionality exists.


**Gary - ATHENA schedule:** Beta release on February 1. Beta = feature freeze. Feb 15: release candidate. March 1: official ATHENA 1.0 release.

STAFF MEETING MINUTES 4/7

Minutes- TARA


**I. Adam Huttler**

Advocacy Round-up:


- NPR-identified number of house republicans who may be open to mobilizing on issue
- K-12 Arts in Education-looking into policy conversations incase potential opportunity arises
- Ask the ED 
- Federal Gov’t Open Data Initiative-are we investigating? 
- Ian re: gov’t data transparency initiative being de-funded, may align ourselves with various efforts to screen-scrap.
- Board Changes- Horace Havemeyer &amp; Eugenie Cowan resigned. No specific reason. Nothing new to report on new board prospects. Letterhead is updated.

**II. Tim Cynova**


- Post Travel Report
- Purpose: To better analyze effectiveness of our travels, as well as tracking use of promo codes. There has been some back and forth RE problems saving files in proper format, but go ahead and save in the report file and let Tim know if there is confusion.
- Monthly Reports (Marketing and Finance) 
- There will be a report-out on all programs and service areas at staff meetings. The same will be done for Marketing via stats (social networks) and will also analyze the effectiveness of marketing channels.
- Suggestions and thoughts for tracking: 
- Google Alerts- Mostly gives back FS mentions, but worth investigating how to filter out alerts that are more substantive, and also a broader look at quantitative data.
- Tracking Associate Member Sign Ups via particular OAN partners- report tracking results via reasons for becoming a member.
- Going to collect a list of tracking we want to see, and perhaps automate weekly reports if possible.
- Tracking FS event attendance coordinating w/sign up.
- Using Artful.ly for tracking- Need to investigate if and how to integrate functionality for tracking these events through Artful.ly 
- Tim taking suggestions for what should be in Monthly reports, throughout next week. Going to collect a list of tracking we want to see, and perhaps automate weekly reports if possible.
- Headshots
- get your approved headshot into approved folder so Tim can upload as gravatar. Staff will use this folder to distribute your photos (see Tim’s e-mail)

**III. New Business**

Status Reports

*Athena/Artful.ly (Gary, Justin, Natale)-* 
- weekly meeting reminder-open to everyone
- Moving forward w/ Ron Evans partnership, still confidential unless otherwise told by Justin
- Athena 1.0 is in final test mode- any minute now
- Artful.ly development progress is going well. Still on target for end of May. Splash page is up.
- Looking for Artful.ly prospects for Beta testers, Natale looking for recommendations from Dianne, Emily, and from various networks. Looking for ticket sellers as well as development users.
- Have a place where we can mark down possible people who may be interested from customer services conversations-perhaps sign up people on splash page.
- Dianne scheduling Talking Point Session for front desk.
- Once Done, Adam and downward to Tiffany and Kirsten will decide to either delay launch or go ahead. 
- Video Q and A session on Athena/Artfully for potential users. Will be posted on Blog eventually.

*Spaces Update (Kirsten)*


- Started data collection for DC Space Finders
- Minnesota and Atlanta are coming up. Hopefully Sacramento later on.
- Hopefully reservations will be up in Bay Area by end of April- NYC after that 
- If you know of any beta testers for NYC reservation system please suggest to Kirsten. 
- Current Spaces Projects up and running: NY,PHILY, DC, MINN, LA, BAY AREA- Kirsten is updating the wiki.

*Member Interaction (Tara)*
- mention poster initiative to members in conversation- refer to blog post from Tara. In short, we are decorating our office walls with member promotional posters. 16x20 thu 24x36 no returns, not taking actual artwork.

*Health Insurance Change (Marie)*

- Pocket Guides have hit membership. People like. 
- Discussion: Reform changing healthcare landscape- companies have been responding aggressively in response. Resulting premium increases. Emblem Health instituted re-certification process and minimum income requirement. We lost 30 people as a result.Talking about HC program direction in light of the future and reform and FA as a whole as the current Business Model no longer makes sense.
- Not enrolling people any more in NY or elsewhere as of May 1.
- Next Step- Play and education/advocacy role- don’t know what that looks like yet, entering exploratory phase. 
- Points- has to be a better use of our resources, and goal to create larger impact instead of focusing on finite number of individuals.
- Developing a webinar (eventually maybe a series) jumping of pocket guide info-educational 
- LINC/FA coalition- RFP for healthcare reform advertising or health insurance in general campaign. No good proposals thus far except for one. 
- Not Kicking out any member currently enrolled (about 300)
- Will be providing widget for auto-quotes via e-healthinsurance.com.


**Thoughts and Questions**

How to present program moving forward? 

There will still be a health insurance section. The program will no longer will steer members to specific plans. The site will act as a platform for advocacy and education. Custumer Service will no longer exist in this area outside of this platform besides what we provide to current enrollees.

Ian- Curious to talk further about how we will fit in with other orgs doing education advocacy work in this area.

Tiffany- Statement to membership? Answer: Quietly flip the switch. For folks that see us through the lens of direct link to health insurance, not necessarily concerned. The same for OAN partners. Access to information about plans is still present in-directly.
Message to note: Side effects of reform: association plans are fading/retaliating, are they even necessary?


**IV. Been**

South by Southwest (Dianne)

Arts Advocay Day(DC) and Emerging Arts Leaders Symbosium (Ian). RE AFTA (Americas for the Arts)- perhaps a narrow scope of effectiveness- absent of big picture- too focused on one issue – (i.e NEA ask rather than the fact that talks of gov’t shut down occurring)

St. Paul Chamber Orchestra- (Huttler) Hunch that conventional advertising was ineffective-as experiment cut advertising to general budget from 500K to 0- result- NO EFFECT!! As a result they now have grant money to experiment new marketing strategies. Part used to bring in outside people for huge brainstorming session. Fun and interesting stuff happening in Twin Cities. Interest in general marketing effectiveness, perhaps we may approach them down the road to contextualize this and share it with public.

Chicago DCA (runs CAR) and WESTAFF (Natale) - what did you talk about? Conversations were good.


**V.Going**
Tiffany to Columbia (the country)

Alex to Edinburough

Adam to Utah- Arts Council Conference

Ian back to DC to NEA present on work done in Cincinnati.

STAFF MEETING MINUTES 5/5

MINUTES : TARA


**I. Adam Huttler**

A.Advocacy Round-Up
Nothing new to report other than, met w/ State legislators in Albany

B. Ask The ED- nothing brought up.

**II. Tim Cynova**

*A. Out of Office Procedure(Vacation, Personal , sick)*

Check w/ your team first and put in on your calendar once it has been approved.
Personal days are short notice vacation days, sick days are for sickness and doc appts.
Summer Fridays are almost here!-Remind Tim when you work on a summer Friday in the afternoon-send it each day you work, don’t wait to calculate it all up at the end.

a.) Spa Castle Day Tues May 17th –delayed celebration of International Womens Day. Most ladies will be leaving the office at 2pm. Max will be at the front desk.


*B.Professional Development and Ticket Allowance*

- Prof Dev. and Member Event money expires at the end of the fiscal year
- Feedback on NYU courses, too expensive i.e Governance and Accounting-intro semester good, second one too specific to accountants.
- Dianne’s public speaking with Diane Leonard is recommended
- Emily has a great experience via The Arts Leadership Institute (conflict management, personnel issues) will distribute name if people are interested- Highly recommended. Ask Jillian how much money you have left for these budgets.

**C. 360 reviews-** internal deadline- Tim will circulate desired completion dates. 


- 2nd part of process will be self assessment; goal setting-
- Tim/Adam will meet with each person upon completion of self review.


**D. Staffing and Time Allocation**


- In conjunction with increased tagging in the Helpdesk for better tracking:
- For one week for anyone dealing w/customer service, you will document what you spend your time on. This will happen the week of May 23rd. 
- Why? 
- It will be useful to see how we use our time and to cross reference these findings with our HD tagging.
- Useful for evaluating, now and for future reference, where we need to hire people. 
- Can be used to identify for yourself where work flow needs to change. 

**E.Finance and Marketing reports- **


- Finance reports are circulated to program directors every morning-what the figures come from: dues, donations, HC fees, LI fees. It compares those figures with yesterday, last yr fiscal year, and in comparison with corresponding line item in our budget. i.e --membership dues-above budget- this may be because of general growth and recent rate increase.
- If anyone wants to see reports Adam will add you to the circulation list. 
- Note, it has shown to be helpful to double check numbers and to analyze drops and major increases

**III. New Business**

*A.Athena 1.0 launch-* 

great buzz on the internet. Currently picked up on Thomas Cott blog and twitter, lots of people are starting to sign up on artful.ly

Software Meeting- as is currently, lots of interest shown.

Artful.ly is set to launch by Memorial Day- first wk in June-Big reveal. 

Direct potential business to Natale and /or Athena@fracturedatlas.org for inquiries

*2.0 Development-* 
more community design sessions and focus groups in the works

Clarification on the Focus of 1.0/Ways to think about Athena vs. Artfully:

Athena portal-- for service organizations that serve arts orgs.

Artful.ly- Individual or org who has heavy ticketing activity- is what people imagined it to be. Don’t know price at this time-not sure if we will go in the direction.

*Community design process-* 
via organizations that work with us as development partner to use to design customized ticketing system- eventually Athena will be only a little bit more expensive to implement-to maintain it will be more cost effective.

Target mid-size to large companies- competition tessitura, ovationtix.

Research other orgs that are selling similar systems to analyze demand to build up marketing and sales strat. But for now will focus on a few key partners to build with. 

Approach- the system is meant to be implemented but not strictly held to guidelines- org customizes independently of us
Features suggested in info sessions from 1.0 may end up in 2.


**B.Health Insurance Change (Marie)**


- Focusing on new activities of the program. Not a tangnible product as in enrollment in plans but rather the services related to plans.
- hands-on intervention and education for the choosing process. 
- Encouragement to take actions, exploring behavior economics. Exciting to see how this might make an impact using a structure for people to take these actions.
- Research psychology behind choice. Old data not helpful in that it does not focus on action. 
- What are the first steps? Webinar and follow up. 
- Next, Shopping with people online in realtime.
- Support for action- changes behavior and thought process instead of hoping they change themselves based on opinions.a)Website is different. Partnership with e-healthinsurance. This will be no different to members as far as what premium rates they get. 
- A Link now exists to healthcare.gov a guide to reform 
- *Will we change name of program and diffuse illusion that we give discounted rates


**C.Liability insurance assessment**


- SURVEY: Sending everyone who purchases a policy a follow up survey which asks-
- did you shop, insurance history, requirement.
- GOAL: trying to gather data doubled amazon gift card incentive and e-mailing people about survey in gene ral. 6 months to get sense of seasonal cycles, comparative industry data.
- Hard to have a control group. Instead, asking people their own perceptions and are would that have been problematic. Hope to put some hard numbers- to say how many people we help, and savings, and allow art to happen.

- This research approach framework as a conceptual technique can transfer over to different programs, but can’t codify it exactly.
- Risk management issue brunch postponed. Scheduling conflict and Rodney Christopher not avail.

**IV. Been/Going- Staff updates**


- Sarah Mclellen- new AA from TCG.
- We are insuring fat tire bear company- traveling road show- performing artists gather to promote bicycling Fort Collins. 
- Dianne and Natale Create Denver Expo
- Emily going to boston opera expo
- Ian-cincinatti- program theoryfollow up. Arts wave…
- Ian Chicago-curation and competition in the arts.
- Athena team to Baltimore.
- Huttler to DC

STAFF MEETING, 8/4/11

1. Tim gave us a printout of the financials rather than reporting

a. FS fees for the year are about $145,000 higher than they really should be because we had the onetime change in how fees are take

**I. Advocacy**

a. Not a lot to report. We were going after NEA research contracts, didn’t get them, bummer.

b. Still in a dance with people at HUB,

c. On the federal level – thinking about what we’ve been doing, how effective, if we want to make some shifts moving forward

d. First year of having a lobbyist on retainer. Intangible progress, no concrete wins. Disappointing given expense and time. Hoping for more concrete.

e. City council meet and greets – we’re thinking about this

 i. Alex and Tim have been talking about scheduling local events with key council people that we have or want to form relationships. Meet and greets.

 ii. Still in the process of working with Jeremy on what they are from our perspective

iii. Idea is having a reason to gather artists together, maybe having a panel, generating discussion around a particular issue.

iv. Thinking about doing 6 in the next year. May try to grab staff members. Probably the next fiscal year.

v. Will probably happen in the council members district.

 vi. Dianne thinks the meet and greets are really ineffective. Conversations that aren’t going anywhere, etc.

vii. Adam thinks it’s unrealistic to expect high level dialogue at these events. High level would be us sitting in a room with their staff. Purpose of these is to remind      them that artists that vote are in their district.

 viii. Alex – we want to balance between the councilperson’s needs and our needs and purposes.


**II. Technology program changes**

a. Questions about how staffing is going to work with Justin’s departure – slight reconfiguration.

i. Kirsten will retain same title – responsible for project management across tech programs, and customer service function. Report directly to Adam, as is Gary, as is Adam. Kara report to Kirsten and be part of her team as a program specialist. Looking to hire an additional tech program specialist – target date is October.

ii. Other thing – every technology or software product will have a dedicated/specific project manager. Additional responsibility within already existing jobs. Shepherding product on a long term level. 

iii. Gary – product manager represents the customer. Content expert and customer expert.

iv. Initial breakdown – Kirsten on spaces, Ian on archipelago, Gary on Athena, Adam on Artful.ly, Adam on Portal


**v. Fiscal sponsorship software?**

1. Short answer – never had a concrete project to do it. Still something we’re interested in doing at some point. Now – we have tentatively committed to over a long time migrating the various tools for managing fiscal sponsorship to Artful.ly

2. In doing that we would develop a lot of code we could move into Athena

3. FA’s fiscal sponsorship is way more technologically advanced than other fiscal sponsors’ programs. We’ve been able to streamline it significantly, and there are people out there who could benefit from that.


**vi. Books – no changes**

1. We have a planning grant, which involves community design process and a technical review

2. Hope is to take another software that was developed for universities and change it and use it.

3. Timeline – was supposed to happen in Sept or Oct, probably pushed back a few months.


**vii. Bloomberg?**

1. Nothing on Bloomberg yet.

**III. Finance**

i. Scheduled to start 8/23 and 8/24 at our accountants office.

ii. Jillian adam and Tim are pulling together information for them.

V. Health insurance renewals – Marie and Tim meeting today to narrow down options. 

VI. Reviews – wrapping up Q2, starting 360 reviews in Q3. How did the 360s go?

a. Dianne – lot of love in it, year before wasn’t a lot of love.

b. More helpful? Always sentences that say the opposite things.

VII. Insurance program specialist – 5 more phone interviews set up tomorrow. Some strong candidates, small pool of applicants. Do some second rounds next week, narrow it down. Want to make sure we get the right person.

VIII. Interruption principle. Tim has noticed that there are more meetings and interactions taking place and more challenging to dig into actual work.

a. Amy suggested blocking off work time – like 10-noon. Don’t know how well we can block off time, but worthwhile to have these conversations with teams. Is it a stand up or a conference room meeting?

b. Adam – certainly if people have ideas or strategies…

c. Ian – so much easier to get work done here in off hours

i. Helpful to formalize? Earlier times, Saturday workdays?

ii. Natale – change some meetings into other… things?

iii. Kirsten – helpful to schedule in blocks

iv. Should we expand the practice of note-taking?

v. Alternate note-taking and attendance per department?

vi. Is it more of a “carve out your own time and chunks of time” kind of thing?

vii. Providing the agenda ahead of time helps everyone plan whether they want to be there, and keeps the meeting on track

viii. Managing personal time – interesting book, “Getting the Right Things Done”

1. Gary also suggested the “Pomodoro” technique

c. FB likes – 125/175 a month

d. CultureFlash, open rate is 43%

e. Pocket of health pocket guide traffic coming to the website

f. Google adwords – in addition to stats, hone in on conversion rate. We have 600 followers on twitter, but how does that help us sell insurance? We’ve been working on adwords for insurance.

g. Would like a one-sheet for the marketing numbers, and some historical context

**III. Artful.ly is up and running!**

a. Working with staff members for usability testing over the next few days

		<field name="title">Presentation Skills with Will Carlin</field>
		<field name="content">In March 2014, presentation and speech coach, Will Carlin conducted a workshop with staff in NYC.

It is hard to capture his presentation in an article, but we've distilled some here. His comprehensive handout is in the Resource Folder of the Netdrive.

### Good Presentations

The best presentations use slides that don’t compete with the presenter in any way. These formatting tips can help you build great slides.

- **Make two decks.** Make one deck just for projecting. This allows you to use fewer words per slide because you will be saying them instead. Make a second version of the deck as a handout for the people who are not in the room.
- **Plan for one key idea and 15 seconds per slide.** This will keep your audience attentive. You will need to create more slides with less information per slide. For webinars where audience attention is even shorter, you may want to increase the number of slides and decrease time per slide to 7-8 seconds.
- **No more than five bullets on a page.** The only exception is if you are conveying a list. 
- **All main bullet text should stay on a single line.** Sub-bullets also should attempt to stay on a single line. This means you are going to have to be concise with your wording. 
- **Eliminate select verbs and articles.**  The audience doesn’t need these to understand your meaning. For example, “Nonprofits largely focused on helping others” is missing the word “are.” This is preferable in bullet points.
- **Help your audience know where they are. **Use chapter headings that correspond to the words you used in the agenda, and consider putting the same chapter headings on each slide in smaller print so that the audience can keep track. 
- **Font sizes should stay the same on all pages.** There is an automatic setting in PowerPoint that resizes your fonts to fit the window, so that if you type more text, it will always fit. This means that you may inadvertently have a number of different font sizes in your presentation. It is subtle, but it means that your audience must readjust each time a new slide appears. Your fonts and font sizes should be the same on all pages. Turn off this setting if necessary.
- **Replace text with images whenever possible. **Whenever you put words on a slide, they involve the language center of the audience’s brain. The problem with that is that the speaker is also involving the same language center. The brain cannot read and listen at the same time. 
- **Use eight words or fewer.** Many studies have shown that a listener can take in a maximum of eight words at a time, without losing focus on the speaker. Even better: combine one or two with a picture. 
- **Fill your slide with a single photograph. **Photographs work unbelievably well to convey information, make a point, and engage emotions. And they work much better if you can see the whole thing. Put words over the image rather than putting words on a slide and then fitting the image around it. 
- **Use a plain background. **A plain background will show your information best. Black or soft, neutral colors are easiest on the eyes. Avoid bright, busy, complicated backgrounds. 
- **Use a clear typeface. **Use a simple typeface that can be read easily from across the room. It should have clear, basic shapes and little or no detail. San serif fonts are best.
- **Choose a basic transition effect and use the same one throughout. **
- **Use animations sparingly, and only use them when you have a reason for the effect. **
- **Use the Fractured Atlas template for title slides.  **

STAFF MEETING 

MINUTES-TARA

9-1-2011



**I. Adam Huttler**

A. Healthcare Program Recap


- Consolidating HC and LI program under Emily- worked out with Marie’s move to Austin. 
- Not enrolling in Group Plans anymore- but keeping on the members currently enrolled. 
- All plans are still available via e-Healthinsurance.com
-  We are available to answer questions through Navigation, Education, and Advocacy, and will continue to do so moving forward. Important to note for members that the plans are still out there, we have not taken away an option, but we have given them more freedom in helping them Navigate. 
- What to say about Marie, cause people are attached to her- She simply moved, and she’s fine! Keep it positive, nothing is missing, nothing taken away.
- What to say in general about the change: This is a way for us to have more control and be of more help. Refocusing efforts to be more proactive in the HC platform, and be of more help to artists- Use the word navigation: helping understand coverage options, prioritize benefits, and navigate the system especially via health proponent. Also help spread awareness and information about upcoming changes in reform in the next couple of years. Health proponent is not a benefit of membership, but staff has been grandfathered in to discount membership with HP


**B. Advocacy: **


- Reassessing our approach to advoacy. 
- Tiffany is organizing City council member meet and greets (Oct/Nov) to bring artists and council members together. In planning phase right now,. More Details TBD


**C. Ask the ED: Who handles IT issues in office now that Justin is gone? **


- Hopefully equipment is up to speed, and any minor issues that come up i.e file recovery can be handled by Tim and Adam. 
- Tim is good a fixing the phones, and may need to follow up with speakeasy on bad customer service. Will be playing with how to use enormous and scary TV.
- Keep taking care of your computers; don’t use your “super” user account unless you are installing something. Don’t forget passwords, doesn’t use “change me”.

STAFF MEETING NOTES, 10/6/11

Slightly different format: program activities first

Sarah and Tara will highlight action items


**ACTION ITEMS:**


- Adam Huttler to add Artful.ly finance reports to Pivotal Tracker
- Program staff will complete customer service time tracking reports from Tuesday, October 12 through Monday, October 17. (Going forward, this will occur the second week of the second month of each quarter.)
- Tim will solicit ideas from the staff for non-arts professionals who might be willing to speak with us on occasion about their work experience and insights.


**MEETING MINUTES:**

**Advocacy Roundup:**


- Holding back a bit on activities, ended retainer with Lobbyist, may start up again at some point
- NYS Senate is stalling on passing legislation to create NYS Health Insurance Exchange, going to be a little while – relevant because we might want to position ourselves as navigators
- Tim: meet and greets coming up, Emily and Dianne are moderators
- Along with Jeremy who is NYC lobbyist, arranging meet and greets with 5 council members who we think we can get discretionary funding from
- Long Island City councilmember meet and greet at Topaz Arts – all members from council district will be invited, will hopefully have artists who will say nice things about arts and how great the council member is for supporting the arts
- Also creating a dialogue with local arts administrator or something – some kind of draw in case the councilmember shows up
- 5 others planned – late October early November as the date range
- Tiffany and Alex are working with Dianne and Emily on getting these together

**Weekly priorities in standup (Adam H):**


- Trying out a new thing to get everyone focused on actionables and short term goals, aware of what each other are working on
- Top priorities for each person for each week
- Emily finds it very useful.

**Adam H, New logo and website redesign (Adam H):**


- Feedback was very helpful
- Universally the feedback was positive

- Rough target go live date is December 1
- Ian question: content?
- Not changing functionality, just adding content for new programs such as Archipelago
- Will add something for advisory services if Ian writes something
- New website redesign will tie to new stationary
- Once website switches over, new stationary letterhead business cards and a new style guide, probably by the second quarter.
- Question: PDFs on old letterhead in the website?
- Do think it’s worth taking a quick pass and knowing what needs to be replaced. Will have new stationary in hand before website design rolls out, if Adam can get files for new website will work on that. 
- Question: is the new website going to have reference to place/displaced?
- Probably not.

- No. Dianne and Tara mention it in the elevator speech

**Quiet Beta**


- Adam Natale signing up spaces, trying to get interest in the board
- Hands on slow process. Somewhere between 5 and 10 venues that have opted in, only a couple that have set it up and started using the calendars. It’s a big jump to start using a new system, trying to work with them to make it easier.
- Tiffany working with Ciara on marketing plan for a big announcement – think it’s the week of the 17th?
- Blog: anything new send to Tim especially if it’s pressing in Tiffany’s absence 
- We just submit for review, Tim will go in and publish it.
- Are we getting new questions about spaces?
- Haven’t said much about it publicly yet
- Any talk of promoting the signed up spaces?
- Lots of ideas and a really small budget
- Have quarterly revenue goals for both projects. Working on weekly metrics to track that will lead to us meeting those goals. Will publicize on the blog.

**Lots of people out in October.**


- Adam just got back from National Fiscal Sponsors network
- Adam Dianne Ian Rodney going to GIA – conference focus “navigating the velocity of change” unfortunately. Themes: art, technology, changing demographics
- Dianne going for a 10am Fiscal Sponsorship talk

- GIA has traditionally only allowed grantmakers to be present, we managed to sneak in under “national partner” program that they instituted last year. 
- Adam doing a talk as part of art and technology preconference – will get in front of every arts funder in the country about data
- Adam H going to Ann Arbor for National Arts Strategies Chief Executive Program

- End of the month will be in Chicago for Independent Sector

- Dianne will send program manual, Artfuly, survey about 1099 service

- First phase of Bay Area Cultural Asset Map has come to a conclusion!
- What does that mean? We fulfilled our contract with them. Want us to apply for a grant to continue to update data for the next 2 years, do a little incremental software development. Will continue to use it as part of their process.
- Blog post in the works?
- bandying idea about Hewlett blog post, but other blog posts are in the works!

Got an email version of FY10 audit yesterday, should have the hard copies soon? people need it for applications

Allison Gallagher coming into the office to start FY11 audit.

**Clarification on refunds:**


- we want to lock the books, for the first time ever
- Think we’re pretty set. If anyone works in refunds for membership dues – anyone who has bought it for more than a month before 9/1, if you are going to be refunding just let Jillian know. You can make the refund, but Jillian needs to know.
- Emily is the only other person with health insurance
- Donations and fund releases – mention that to Alex, she also does edits. Jillian has talked about this with Alex and also gets those emails so she can catch things.
- Question: if we are refunding membership dues from August – can still hit refund in the database. Refund will not be cut as a check we cut a check if it’s more than 90 days, but otherwise you can refund yourself.
- When we start the audit, we send Alison numbers, but if we make changes her numbers get skewed. Don’t want numbers to change between when we send them to her and when we get her adjustments back.
- Think we’ve worked out a number of kinks that resulted in a late audit this year. Trying to make this much faster.
- Question: any update on IRS audit?
- Scheduled next in person 10/25 and 10/27, here at the office. Greg and Alison from Moses and Schrieber will be here. we receive questions after they meet, and we will have more material when they meet again. Think they’re through board packets and general ledger now – haven’t hit fiscal sponsorship
- Adam is the only person authorized to say anything to IRS. We’ve been advised by accountants and lawyers that Adam should not be on premises when they’re here.

Holiday party: 12/9

Tim working on handbook updates. Slow process and slides behind the fires. It’s on Tim’s priorities standup. Hopefully will be done by next week.

At some point during the summer talked about on a quarterly basis doing staff time percentage allotments. Decided that second week of second month of the quarter, which is next week will use this along with HD tickets to track distribution of time. Do Tuesday through Monday b/c Columbus Day

**New positions**


- PA: 125 people who did it correctly, 25 people were Nos because they did it incorrectly
- Next week phones, following week in person
- end of October know who PA will be
- Still working on moving parts with Tech Specialist

**Tim has an idea:**

Several of us know people who work outside the arts but have experiences and advice and insight that might be fun to tap.
Thinking about visiting professionals – like an hour a month


- Someone who used to run Arbitron, came up with Bill Cosby for Jello
- Dianne’s brother elected official
- How did you manage your time, your staff, what’s important?
- Do we like this idea? yes we do!
- Also curious to know as we think about it, who would be cool to bring in (or not cool and interesting?)
- Tim will send an email out about visiting professionals non-arts related
- Is there compensation? No there is not. Will probably give them a bottle of something.
- Adam not opposed to paying an honorarium if it makes total sense.

**Anything else?**

Jillian: you mentioned some staff building things coming up, is that still happening?

- At the mercy of Amy’s schedule, but yes it’s happening.

Board meeting: can someone volunteer to make copies of the board packet? Sarah and Tara will take care of it.</field>

### June Action Items (2 minutes)

### 3 Minutes of Fame: Visa Applicant Edition (Holly)

- Wanted to do Visa Letters because sometimes forget about this service. Most letters are for o-1b visas which are for artists of extraordinary ability. I wanted to show some weird examples of artists who have gotten visa letters through us.

- Eliska Podzimkova ,https://instagram.com/animateny- We'll look at her Instagram to see type of work she does. She is from the Czech Republic and her work focuses on New York.
- Liana Yaroslavsky, http://lianayar.com/ - She is a furniture designer from Russia who designs coffee tables and side tables. We didn't think she would be able to get visa, but decided there was an artistic quality to the tables.
- Bryn Court, http://www.moviesculptor.com/ - He is a Scenic sculpting consultant from the UK. He has designed sculptures for a lot of movies and wanted a visa to sculpt items for the Harry Potter theme park.
- Robyn &quot;Rihanna&quot; Fenty, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao8cGLIMtvg - Sent out Rihanna's video- we all know rihanna, but thought the video also thematically linked to immigration.

### Ask the ED: Adam Huttler (10 minutes)

Before we go to questions, I want to explain what I will be doing in the month of August. I have done this the last two years and will be doing it again this year--hermitage. The idea is to take a month to be totally disconnected from day to day work and to focus on a project with sustained attention. There is also practical value for everyone else to be reminded that I am totally unnecessary to running day to day of FA. This year's plan is to work with the team working on microphilanthropy software, to technically define requirements that need to be rebuilt. The benefit to choosing this for the hermitage is to work out all the details--things that would be missed if not intentional. I know the existing software pretty well so that should speed development and make better. Still working out communication with Mauricio and Dan. I'm looking forward to it.

**Questions?**

*Q (MLS)- What's the timing with labor day being so late?* A- I will be coming back first week of September

*Q- What if people need you?* A- It depends on what the need is. On certain things, people will need to just need to make a decision or wait until I am back. For tech issues, talk to Shawn and do what you normally would do if I am out. 2 people will have a bat phone- Tim and Shawn. You will have to go through them to get to me.

*Q (Christine)-* *Will they be building the functionality for the process implemented during the month?* A-The idea is to run a bunch of R Spec tests. Development methodology to use special set of code to define tests that can run in an automated way to confirm or not to see if works the way we want. It's a cool way to develop software. For those unfamiliar, make tests first, then write code to make the tests pass. It's a way for me to stay out of the way for people to code, but make something useful for developers.

*Q (Malcolm)-After Holly (Sidford) was here earlier this week, I am riled up by state of the art world. Within and outside of our current programs, if we understand race, gender, etc. to be barriers, what are we doing?* A-On a basic level, FA exists to try and disrupt the existing system. When starting FA, there was the focus on the size of organization. This is still a meaningful way to look at things. Our mission = eliminate practical barriers, and all that you have mentioned do work as barriers. I do think they are relevant. Having FA as an anti-racist org is a way to see how race plays into these barriers. Where it gets complicated is how do we change our services to focus on those specific things instead of casting a wide net. Jason and Ian spend a lot of time thinking about specific communities that we are not reaching and what we need to do to reach them. There is not a magic bullet on this, it's a slog. One example that pops into my mind that is timely is that Lisa is working with is disability in dance. Pleased that we are able to engage that work.

*Lisa-* Found interesting in projects that wanted to apply for fiscal sponsorship but wanted to ask first, but was unsure. They didn't know if they were invited. If they had seen other projects like themselves they might not hesitate.

*Adam- *I like the phrase &quot;didn't feel invited.&quot; My bias is that just having it open is enough, but that is not enough. We do need to make the special effort and show up in those communities.

*Jason-* I have been able to travel to specific gatherings around the country and something that struck me being in those spaces is that almost nobody knows FA. At other arts events, people know who FA is--there's an aura. This also cements in my mind how much we need to get in front of people. It's great that we have small initiatives, but need to make more part of everyday organization.

### Director Reports (20 Minutes)


**a. Shawn Anderson -** trying to get back to normal after TG3, Chap has been working on Make Time Clock, Dan and Mauricio are working on having the Power 2Give site up and ready to launch end of summer. Christine and Eric have been doing all the maintenance of different things.

-Shawn is on vacation next week

**b. Scott Raker**  Burning man update- Adam was able to have the interface and we are getting lots of quotes within 1-2 days. There is a range of prices depending on what it is for,but the quotes are good prices. The whole team took a trip to Baltimore to meet face to face. Talked about streamlining the processes. We also got stuck in oldest elevator in Baltimore. http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-08-23/features/0308230020_1_otis-rope-guide-rails

When I'm out, tasks will be taken on by insurance team, and also Courtney and Deborah will be writing visa letters. I will be gone any day now for 3 weeks.

**c. Dianne Debicella (Dianne out- Theresa)** We're moving toward beta testing for Power2Give site, and making training webinars for curators (site hosts). Also, FS team is redoing webinars to get fresh look and creating new grant and donation resources to give best practices.

**d. Marie-Louise Stegall-** We're closing in at the end of the FY so we have a more solid view of how we will end up. We're about 90% there of all given and pledges which is a 35% increase from last year. We're looking forward to FY16 which already has quite a bit of pledges and given. Thanks all for helping out with various applications. -Also working on event.

**e. Ian David Moss -**Last month we did our first survey of staff. I will be sending out a written recap of results. Generally there were strong results overall. I was impressed with how positive it was. The most agreed statement was &quot;Overall I'm happy to be working at FA&quot; with 93% agreeing with statement. The least agreed was &quot;do you believe that you are fairly compensated,&quot; although more agreed than disagreed. From the attraction form, other people at FA and culture are a big factor in wanting people to work here, especially in interview and job description. Overall, things are pretty good. There will be more details to share in the written recap.

This is part of a larger process to make a data dashboard as a set of numbers relating to standard operating, need more data gathering. -Also working on theories of change for different programs. Also looking ahead, working on something brought up at the last offsite--sense of return on investment on travel.

**Q (Lisa)- **Is the data dashboard one of the ways we can answer diversification part of the everyday A(Ian)- It could be helpful, but is not the answer with a capital A. We will have numbers that speak to that, it will be something to look at on an regular basis, and also will be a resource for what can we do to yield results.

**f. Selena Juneau-Vogel** Thanks for being nice, with the rough month we had. Things are smoothly running now. This summer we will do a serious brand book clean up of KB articles. Next week we will release some new features including: record staff members who took order, users can record nick names, can opt in to get an email any time a donation is made (501(c)3), can sell tickets again and count as donation if person cannot attend. Right now these are just for 501(c)3s but will eventually be for FS projects as well. I will be working with Theresa on the nitty-gritty of artful.ly to help integration with FS projects. The 4 program directors have been meeting on regular basis to streamline customer service experience, looking at incremental things that would help program administration. Looking at big issues that need larger focus. Example- it may make sense to track customer service on an organizational level instead of on a program level. We want to track correspondence with organizations and not just the people (would be helpful for organizations with staff turnover).

**Q (Nathan)-** Does big picture include staff behavior (are we rude)? A(Selena)- Hasn't come up yet, but looking at how we continue thematic goal to make a better customer experience. Lisa- sounds like Nathan is asking about how to improve not on a feature base- There will be training and best practices to focus on looking at people from this org level.

**g. Lisa Niedermeyer** 2 buckets of time, primarily- disability in dance and increasing space inventory Disability- outreach and looking at features Inventory- looking at Toronto and Birmingham, which are smaller pots but are brand new and have developing arts.

### Other Reports (10 Minutes)


**a. Task Force Reports**

*i. Make Time Clock (Chap)* We're headed to Chicago next week, so there's lots of stuff around that. We sent an email to Chicago members, and have gotten RSVPs to the event. We're shifting to thinking about the croudfunding part. Be aware that we are becoming more intentionally public. We are building a community that will be there at the launch.

*ii. #ArtStartUp A few things-* we are hosting game nights this month. There's one at 6:30 tonight and will be a few more. We will be playing games to see how people learn games. We have a survey, which would be great if you could share around. We also launched a micro site. The timeline is for July to be research, Aug - Oct- there will be small play test with staff, and in Nov there will be public play test. The survey is on the blog post and on micro site. https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/blog/2015/07/07/were-making-a-card-game-and-we-want-you-to-be-a-part-of-it/

*iii. Educational Events (Juliana)* We're having an event on July 27 that is educational in nature at the QCA (Queens Council on the Arts). We have 27 RSVPs, and will do another push in a few weeks. We're good on staffing, but let me know if you are super interested. Q- Is it on line? A- Event is on blog and live on Artful.ly.

*b. Arts &amp; Technology Fellowship Report* There's a house bill dealing with the appropriation of money to cultural agencies. This has brought lots of art organizations and lobbyists to the hill, and people are really focusing on that. There are a few things on the chopping block, like place making grants. There's also momentum dealing with education. The arts interest are amendments on the arts side of things--art as core academic subject, teacher training, etc. Because of all this, I will be pausing outreach on the hill until August. The Frozen Parody will debut in the spring for Fair Use week.

### Operations Updates (15 Minutes)


**a. How We Work (Tim)**

*Renovation:* You have probably seen people coming through office looking around and measuring. Nicola and I have been working with people on the aesthetics of the space. Just switching out furniture would not look so great, so we're looking into options to change the look of the space with carpet and paint. The people we are working with will give us a full plan to see how to turn it into reality. Nicola is working on this because everyone might have to work off-site for a week to do install. This could be at some point in late August and early September. We will let everyone know when we know the exact dates.

*Laptops:*Thanks for taking the survey, everyone. Shawn has been working on the Mac option for everyone. There will still be some people on PCs for various reasons, but most everyone will be on Macs by the end of July. We will start switching over in waves, so not everyone will get laptops at the same time. They will be retina Mac book pros because most people want closed laptops with dual monitors. Nicola has been doing a monitor survey. Lots of things are being cued up, and we will let you know when we have more information.

*401k:* Jillian has been spearing the 401k switch. It's pretty complicated, but she has been doing great work on it. The goal is to have conversations in August, both a talk with a financial advisor about how it will work and also personal sit downs. There are no dates yet, but Jillian wants it wrapped up by end of the FY. It's not through Paychex. On January 1 we're looking to change payroll services to Zen. At that point everything will be streamlined again.

*2 positions are live for staffing. *For the Director of Programs, interviews will start next week. There is no deadline, but we would like to get some interviews done before Adam's hermitage. The Program associate position is up, so spread the word. The numbers are ramping up. Let Nicola know if you have recommended anyone and she will put at top of the pile.

*We will be getting rid of Wiki at the end of August* and will be putting everything over to the internal Knowledge Base. Selena is working on categories. Also, are there ideas for names? Selena- I'm likeing IKB, as a reference to International Klein Blue. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Klein_Blue

**b. Finance Report (Tim)** If you look at the report printed in color, it is not pretty. It's actually pretty concerning. We are tracking some of the numbers because we have been slightly off pace. Some will not end where we thought they would. We are looking at what we can do for the future. This is the first year where we will not hit many of the goals. Adam- I stand by and think that membership dues will be right on. Tim- A couple of things that are serious- Fiscal Sponsorship numbers because it's our biggest revenue engine. That's a huge fall off from where we were hoping to be. Adam and I are looking at this. This year effects next budget. I will pass on any things if all need to know or if anything is actionable.

**c. End-of-FY Finances (Nicola)**

*Prepaid expenses-* Just a reminder that as we close this FY in August, we need to be aware of any prepaid expenses because we account for them differently. Any time you purchase something for next FY, please make note of this in the email for reimbursement or CC notes. An example is if you buy a flight in August, but the flight is not until September. Since the flight happens in September, we need to account for it as a prepaid expense. Feel free to email me if you have any questions.

*Professional Development Stipends and member ticket allowance-* We are also coming to the close of this FY's professional development and ticket stipend. I'll be sending updated totals in the next week so that you know where you are at. Remember that it does not roll over, but also note that similarly to prepaid expenses, if the class or show is in September, it count's for next FY stipend, even if you purchase it in August.

**d. Staff Meeting Chairs (Nicola)** We need volunteers to be meeting chairs! Email me if you have any interest and I'll set up chairs starting in September.

**e. Summer Party (Nicola) -**You all should have gotten the super cool invite that Malcolm put together. We have some exciting stuff planned for you all. If you have not yet RSVPd, please do that. If you want to contribute any food dish, email Jillian. Also, if you have any pictures of you at camp, send them my way. If you didn't go to a formal summer camp, other things that are acceptable include: you playing sports, going camping with family or friends, making crafts, going fishing, doing whatever you did summers off.

### Wrap-Up &amp; July Actionables (5 Minutes)




- Take note that people will be gone, so plan to talk to people before or after they are away.
- Email Nicola if you want to be an all-staff meeting chair.

**I. Adam Huttler (20 minutes)**

A. Recent Changes

- Kirsten and Micah leaving. 
- Selena and Lisa starting. 
- Tiffany Leaving
 - Adam wants to have open forum here for questions and comments, they are welcome. RE: Rumors that people aren’t entirely clear on the process of deciding to let someone go. Happy to speak to that either now or in private. He has never fired anyone without multiple explicit or near explicit warnings. Always want to provide chance for constructive feedback and time to make changes before it gets to that point.

Ian (Q)- Are there examples of people who had received warnings and stayed on as valued members of the team? (A)- Yes! Only exceptions to this process are that it becomes obvious within the first week or two that it won’t work out.

Questions for Kirsten and Micah?
- Kirsten going to be a product manager for a new start up. Can’t give details but in no way competitive w/ FA. Adam is sad to let them go but happy they have a great opportunity. It was a hard and sad decision. 

Questions about Tiffany? 
- Not filling a position for marketing. Well, not immediately, but good chance that the seat will be filled with a different job description. It is clear that we are understaffed as far as the external relations team. Program staff will play a more active role in program marketing than in the past. Trying to figure out where needs lay moving forward. Will move on it sooner rather than later. 

New Hires
- Selena coming in on Monday, Lisa the following Monday. Checking references for the new PA. Looking at hire date the first week of Dec. There was a 3rd round interview project for the PA position which involved researching pocket guides and handling real questions from HD.


**B. Ask The ED**

Jillian (Q)- How was your month away? (A)It was good. Chief Exec Program in Ann Arbor was a wonderful experience. Lots of Educational Info and Networking. 

General Comments:

- Adam is also out at the end of the week to meet w/ Jay Douglass Holiday in DC. 
- Out Monday and Tuesday at Arizona State for presentation to students on New Business Models.
- Mentioned his presentation on Athena, and how it relates to people who are not familiar with FA. Like for instance its potential for eventual Invoicing and book keeping, made so much easier thanks to technology. Done by computers rather than armies of people in cubicles. This is why Jillian is a part time book keeper focused on forensic style accounting and Tim can focus on reporting and budgeting. It is a huge deal. Ticketing and CRM is a great exciting start to Athena, but the real vision is Athena Accounting.

**II. Program Activities**

A. Events

*1. CM Meet and Greets.* 3 coming up with various council members moderated by Emily and Dianne. Monday’s event from 6-8. in east harlem (alex is moderating). Working on Spreading the word. Also on FB and Twitter

*2. Space Solutions (Kara/Tim)-* Invited by Gina to co-host community conversation about space issues. Ciara working with Gina’s people to market and coordinate. RSVP list looking good. 4 people from DCA, exploring metropolis, etc. 45 minute open coversation, Kara demoing software. Gina providing refreshments.

*3. Bushwick Member Event (Dianne/Emily)*
A Fun Network-y party. Shooting for mid-december with represetivites of arts orgs in Bushwick, along with an open conversation. Still finalizing details, probably week of December 12th

Started as conversation between Emily and JeanneAnn and Ian about smaller arts spaces in Bushwick. How they are in high-risk areas, but are still too cool for insurance. How do we bridge this gap? Also, how can we address level of theft and vandalism in spaces in Bushwick. We want to start talking to them about low level risk management, and ease into thinking about insurance. How do you be safe and still be cool and have insurance. Ian- Mentioned looking at an Org in San Fran that works with a of DIY arts as an example of approach to the topic.

Juliana- mentioned Todd P of market hotel to approach as a connection to drum up buzz and attendance for event.
Once we think we can develop this idea on a more national level we will approach FMC for help.

**B. E-healthinsurance. **

The Issue: It Hasn’t been working via FA site. (the free quote estimator) it wasn’t tracking FA quotes and getting commission on it. After 1st 6 weeks, there were 4000 clicks but with no quotes. E-healthinsurance folks are going to look at Nov quote/clicks ratios, and they are going to retroactively pay us a commission. $60 bucks from 3 quotes. By far the best online HC quoting engine so far. Rates are set by law. It shows people all of their options. If there are state subsidized plans, they still show up on e-health, but the eligibility is not well marked. Encourage people to use it! (when appropriate).

**C. Artful.ly Update (Kara)**

Supposedly 41 tickets sold. Noted that 3.5 percent cc fee is a pass through, not an artful.ly fee.

**D. Spaces (Kirsten)**

There are existing files for publically launched implementations. For cities currently in data collection- these instances are not public, but you can share with people that it is in the works. Cities up next: Next fall- Austin, and next winter spring, Salt Lake City

Looking Forward:
Hopefully more developments with online booking. 
Trying to document all partner relationships in High Rise. Also a good place to keep track of OAN partners.


**E. Been/Going**


- Everyone: Half day wed before Thanksgiving, closed Thursday and Friday
- DECEMBER
- Ian- in Chicago
- Alex going to NAMP and maybe with Ian
- Dianne Art Basil in Dec.

- We’ve added extra locks to freight entrance, and a plate has been added to main elevator door. 
- Conclusion of last week’s security breach: A messenger picked the lock to use the bathroom about 20 sec after Adam walked in. 
- Tim has a better grasp on cameras now that he met with Mr. Burdu in the basement, and found that there is no camera in the foyer.
- IMPORTANT! Make sure the door is all the way closed- the lock does not always latch.

H. Holiday Party on Dec 9th in Metuchen. Vacation days end at the end of the year. Refer to roll-over policy in handbook. 

I. Zimbra/Firefox bug- Adam suggests zimbra desktop client. Right now in firefox, files cannot be dragged. 

J. Computer wiping and desk movement happening, in prep for New Hires starting with Selena. If interested in moving let Tim Know. (Kirsten’s desk is taken by Dianne) 

K. New Website- time consuming but target date is still Dec 1.

L. Juliana submitted paper work to Actor’s federal credit union. This is for staff not members. Will keep us updated. (they own all the atm’s in Macdonalds)

**Action Items from last month:**

- Dianne and Emily finalizing member event in Bushwick (program activity)

- Emily can quote eHealthinsurance
- Sarah is looking for member profiles and monthly from the fields people
- Next Tues getting a dedicated internet line to conference room
- Juliana submitted credit union paperwork – it’s pending.


**Ask the ED:**
- When is the new website is launching?
 - As soon as it’s ready. Hopefully soon. Everything else is on hold. 80% there – last details are much more stretched out. 12/15 would be great? January 1st at the latest.
 - Will need people to look at it and make sure that things look right. From a stylistic point of view.
- Advocacy – gearing up to put thoughts out about a few bills in DC that are getting attention right now. House bill is more egregious – SOPA; Senate “Protect IP” act. Both ostensibly intended to protect copyright holders from piracy, but are both misguided in Adam’s view. All major arts unions have come out in favor as they are ostensibly pro content-generator, but Adam thinks they’re bad legislation. Tech community also thinks it’s bad legislation.

**Program Activities (Bushwick Event, MDP meeting, Artful.ly release):**
- Bushwick Event:
 - Taking place on 12/16
 - VLA; Kickstarter; Etsy; member groups to be there personally
 - Hosted by Third Ward, they have donated their space and are helping publicize it
 - Could host up to 600! If it’s that, we should re-think the amount of wine to buy.
 - Just before the party Jean Anne and Emily are getting some people together in Bushwick to talk about insurance and risk management – with an eye to developing small risk management program that people can put in place in their spaces that will help them get insurance.
 - Have volunteer bartenders from 3rd Ward; could use staff volunteers
 - Adam suggests sending announcements via mail chimp to a targeted segment of the city
 - Using Artful.ly for RSVPs!
 - Don’t have to be a member to be there. It’s a networking event for the arts in NYC. Could offer people free 3 months of membership.
- MDP meeting next week (12/8):
 - MDP is kind of the reason our insurance program exists. Firm itself also runs a program to insure national registry of historic places – very successful. 
 - We absolutely can’t do this program without them.
 - Annual meeting – discuss technology, customer service, priorities, etc.
- Pending programs: risk purchasing group, workers comp safety group for performing arts orgs in New York
- Artful.ly
 - Importing and exporting rolled out this morning.

**Swing Office**
- glitch in Zimbra – must schedule them through the web browser.

- To invite the side conference room, type “Side” email address or something.

**Handbook updates:**
- will go into effect on 1/1/12.
- Have added a social media policy.
- 2012: weird year for days off. 1st 8 months are 2/3 of days off, re-set on the fiscal year. Refer to employee handbook for clarification.
- Any accrued summer Fridays – based rollover on total vacation number. Will be included in the end of August. 
- Let Tim know if you find any errors in the vacation/sick day policy, etc.
- Org chart shifts – handbook reflects the new org chart
- Non management personnel sick days – when you’re sick you’re sick.

Looking into a camera for the foyer – it’s a challenge, there are a lot of terrible cameras we could buy, but for now deadbolt and locking is the way to go.</field>

There is no static pages on our website, but in the redesign process the trick is to address content information changes that happen in multiple places at once.

Hopefully close to roll-out soon, its bottle necking some other projects.

Why are we changing the logo- cause it sucked, long overdue

Noah Skanlan for ALR design is working on this project.

Phasing out pins and tote bags, questioning the use of the star on swag items

*Letterhead in the works.* How do we feel about board list being preprinted on letterhead?

For fundraising purposes and formality sake, yes. Perhaps we’ll have two versions. Maybe we’ll wait till after new board member officers are in place to order that type letterhead.

Tim will send out an e-mail after first printed round for feedback on changes that need to be

made.

*IRS audit still in process-* Jillian et al: thanks everyone who has helped pull documents for the audit.  Shout outs to Alex, Nathan, and  Max.

*Update-SOPA Bill opposition:* Had conversation with Senator’s office- letter drafted to senate leadership to pause before rushing through legislation. Reaching out to other orgs who represent copywriter owners.

 

**PROGRAM UPDATES**

*Customer Service Analysis: * Customer Service Staff are getting together next week to figure out how long we spend on specific tasks (estimation poker).

The week after MLK  short week, we will be tracing time again and comparing findings from the week before. The tracking will account for these specific tasks.  We will compare both analysis system to see if we should continue time trackers.

About Estimation poker- whoever submits high/low numbers will get the chance to defend why things take certain lengths of time.

The hope is to be able to look at every single task and know who much time it takes.

How did this all come about? To get a handle on why we are so busy, how we are using our time.  Giving a better picture of staffing needs in relation to program growth in an objective way.

 

*Sundance: *Officially announcing our partnership shortly. Festival at the end of Feb. Emily and Bob and 1700 people from Chub. Chub sponsoring afternoon cocktail reception co-branded with Fractured Atlas. Emily also presenting on services applicable to film makers, which will take place at a whiskey distillery. Artful.ly may be used to take rsvps to the event.

 

*emailing from Mailchimp- *can’t e-blast even from segmented list to excessively.. we have to be choose carefully about being  to prevent spam blocks.

 
*
Curated Page on kickstarter for members*. To highlight any members that are using kickstarter. Will  state tax deductibility, not related to donations through fractured atlas.

There always needs to be 3 active campaigns going on to be promoted on the page.

Estimation Poker- Went well, stats have not been calculated yet.

**ADAM HUTTLER**

*Stategic Opportunites Memo-* Do people have questions?


- How do you grade Organization Performance?not scientific, gut sense of realm of possibility. Generally harsh rater.
- Please read over the categories to get a sense of what is being rated.
- How do responses work? Program Directors historically and moving forward submit responses that will be presented to the board. Format of responses are basically cut and pasted into a final document.
- What is useful in terms of staff responses?
- An excersise of gaining perspective on how the individual work fits into the whole org.
- Useful to read each others thoughts, an opportunity to connect dots.
- Useful for the board to get a clear more concrete picture of the org. More tacticle information that connects individual board members to their area of expertise.
- Not necessary to get into week-to-week details, but a more general overview and comment on future goals.

**Meetings**

- Ian and Adam went to Boston to Discuss Archipelego funding
- Coming Up DC- meeting with FMC and Google

*Audit Updates- *next session is coming up. Auditors still requesting information including about the charitablity of our activities. Most pointedly about the insurance program. In terms of 501M tax code, “providing” indicates insurance company, and we of course are not. Legal Councel (Greg Colvin) are assisting us in a response to this.


**PROGRAM ACTIVITES**

**NOTES**

**Review of last month’s action items -	**
NYCPASPACES on the wiki -	Have a look at the blog post regarding event ticketing -	Get in touch with Natale if you have Cultureflash stuff

**Ask the ED -**	
*Future of Music Coalition:* 


- Have been having an ongoing conversation for a while o	Starting to look like something might solidify and take shape o	In the wake of SOPA PIPA, started looking at that as a prototype of type of work we might do – looking at harmonize cultural policy and technology policy, as they’re often pitted against each other. Adam thinks it’s not accurate or helpful, and there’s a good opportunity and ideological niche to go into. Also a possibility of getting funding from tech interests who are in a position to benefit from that narrative being dismantled a bit. o	Have been talking with Google, also have a meeting with Union Square Ventures, NYC based venture capital firm. Also Kickstarter and others. o	If we can raise money we’re looking at doing a strategic plan over 6-9 months, if we raise less money, thinking about a jointly managed policy institute that would be in DC, with: Research (we would manage), Policy and Analysis (FMC would manage), Community Organizing (both of us would manage) o	Lisa asks who they are? 
- They’re a DC based “think tank” which Adam thinks isn’t totally inaccurate 
- Not as old as we are. Do a lot of work looking at the Future of Music. One of first people to talk about net neutrality, instrumental in getting low power radio legislation passed, released an interesting study on artist revenue streams o	Gary asks if they’re Nonprofit? •	Yes they are. 
- How does Union Square Ventures figure into this? 
- Not totally sure, but it was a good meeting. Their model is venture capital. They’re starting an entity of their own that will be looking at these ventures from a tech-centric viewpoint. Will probably be a nonprofit, but probably they’ll be looking for a way to do some kind of for profit model. They’d probably make some kind of contribution, but more likely they’d be taking an ongoing role with helping to connect the tech institute to people in the tech community. For example, they have a lot of music tech startups, maybe they would pay some kind of subscription fee and they would get access to the raw data.

*Strategic Priorities Memo –* 


- any thoughts on that? Anyone read it? 
- Emily says it’s helpful. Helpful to see the language that people use to talk about their corners of Fractured Atlas. Tone, language, ways of approaching. 
- Helpful to see how people approach these different ideas. 
- Ian felt inspired to access Big Thinking after reading other people’s responses. 
- Any epiphanies or areas of connection that people recognized? o	Helps have a more holistic sense of everything 
 -  Ian was a bit confused by different formats people used to respond 
 -  maybe helpful to set up the responses as bullet points, then organize by bullet point? Might help people who aren’t required to respond to respond to individual points.

*Ask the ED -*	Nada!

**Program activities: **

*Philly member party* is happening on Tues 3/27 at the Trestle Inn, a newer artist friendly establishment that Kara and Lois from DanceUSA recommended. 
- We have a private room, from 5:30p-8:30p 
- Who intends on going? 
- Lisa’s going to go, and bring the Philly Space Finder person with him. 
- Mailchimp is sending to about 520 people, and push it via social media. 
- Feel free to send to other people in the area -	Hoping for 30-50 people 
- Partnering with DanceUSA Philly and other local arts orgs

*Health Insurace focus groups:* 


- had a focus group in DC last week, was raining, had invited 12 people but 6 people showed up. Split between 25 and younger and 50 and older, and most were insured, which was not the intention. 
- Most people want free health insurance, or a $50-100 plan that covers absolutely everything.
- Found out that they find information about health insurance via Twitter (?!) sense is it’s them paying attention to what’s happening via twitter.? 
- In that group, people are looking very much at segments of their lives and friends and families to get info on health insurance.
- Comments like “there should be some kind of nonprofit that helps people get information about health insurance!” sooo… need some education there. 
- Chicago just happened, NYC next week, re-doing DC because it went so badly. 
- Then just have to decide what to do with it if we’re going to do anything with it. 
- How can we help people now and not scare them in 2014? 
- Some people thought they would go to jail in 2014 if they weren’t insured!

*Credit Unions! *

- you can all sign up for the Actors Federal Credit Union 
- meeting today will be at 4pm 
- would like to get some info on timing of member surveys 
- will be doing some kind of focus groups or since they’re unpaid, “pocus troops” 
- still trying to locate mentors or people who have experience 
- Why did we join AFCU again? 
 - Were interested in it for members, but couldn’t because our members don’t really have a vote. Have been talking to them about our members for about a year, but they were worried about us starting our own credit union… which we’re doing! 
 - Getting a loan from a credit union is much easier, also their credit card rate is great

**Travel**
- Dianne was in CA 
 -  SF for 2 days, spoke at California College of Arts and then LA for College Art Association 
 - Went to indiegogo office, met some staff. Lot of cute dogs in the office. 
 - Also met with SF film society and Bay Area video association 
 - In LA had the crowdfunding panel at CAA – first time we went to this conference, not sure if it’s the best fit. About 5-6K people, but individual artists are there trying to get academic positions. Very academic. Most people going didn’t attend the professional development sessions. Put all PD sessions at the same time. 
 - People do seem to go to the tables, but not a lot of tech savvy attendees. 
 - Had Kickstarter/Fractured Atlas party at a gallery with dungeons and dragons artwork. Everyone thought it was our artwork. 
 - Did people come to the party because of Kickstarter or FA? It was a mix. Wondering why we were with each other. 
 - Kickstarter no longer wants to be identified as “crowdfunding,” they want to be known as “Kickstarter.” 
 - Trying to move away from being known as a crowdfunding platform. 
 - KS put out a press release that they’re on pace to give more money than the NEA, and that made Adam H irritated
- Adam H going to CA 
- Ian going to CA to speak at Arts Enterprise Summit 
 - Org that tries to connect business school grads with artists 
 - Doing a workshop on the “well informed arts professional” 
- SXSW coming up, Dianne first, also going to Houston and Austin to do a grants panel and a party with Indiegogo on Monday night, Adam second doing music. Adam’s up against the guy who wrote Rainbow connection. Also trying to do an Artfully and maybe a Spaces workshop in Austin, then going to Houston and going to Spacetaker, meeting with Houston endowment and an org that might be interested in Athena. 
- Jean Anne going on first road trip to Chicago! Waiting on hearing back on her workshop – “Insurance for Risk Takers.” Dianne is also going, doing a session on Fiscal Sponsorship and Crowdfunding. 
- Juliana going to Atlanta for Atlanta Film Festival. Strange radio silence since she booked her film, Emily hasn’t heard anything at all about her session either. 
- Gamification workshop tonight? 
 - Workshop being hosted by Engine Yeard on “gamification” – making things more game like and therefore more attractive

**Program-related items?** 
- we no longer mail checks to vendors. We cut checks to vendors, we don’t mail checks to vendors. -
- Are we making an announcement? Putting it on Twitter and making another announcement soon. 
- Push EFT!

**2 open positions:**
- Tech and grantwriting. Trying to get grantwriting in place before tech.

**Finance reports:**
- today starts Q3, yesterday ended Q2
- Liability Insurance – were using a company that backed out, had to find a new company. There is some seasonality, seeing a big increase in volume right now. Still at an early stage in knowing how to budget properly for LI. Possibility that income projections were a little aggressive. 
- There is an impulse to be conservative when budgeting because it feels good to surpass goals, but Adam would encourage us to be accurate. Would rather see you miss by 5% on an ambitious goal that exceed by 50% on a stupid goal. 
- Adam and Tim made first pass on FY13, will be bringing it to directors in the coming weeks.</field>

Full Staff Meeting Thursday, April 5th 12:00pm-1:00pm

Minutes: Theresa

March Action Items

  *Send Adam N Cultureflash topics: technology, fundraising/devo/marketing, “the big idea” or any relevant blog posts you want to be syndicated. Send at any time, Adam will keep them on file.
  * Philly party: Feel free to send to other people in the area and spread the word

Agenda I. Adam Huttler

  A. Critical Path Documents
     1. Request from the board about higher level visibility-Management roadmap.    
     2. What are key milestones/goals?  How are we doing?  Have we missed any?  How many times have we let that one slip? 
     3. Working on 4 currently: Athena/Artful.ly, Spaces, Archipelago, Credit Union.  Due soon (now). 
     4. If Emily or Dianne wants to do one-go for it!
  B. Ask the Ed
     1. Fonts: Is any one else having trouble installing fonts?  What do we do with the style guide?  Will it still work if document is protected?
        a. Word has style sets, then you don’t need to mess with fonts.  To use style set, you should not need to install new fonts.   
        b. If you cannot edit doc, you cannot edit style set.  
        c. If you’re regularly creating word docs, ask Tim, Adam or Dianne how to use style set. 
        d. Noah suggested some substitution fonts-should be installed.  
II. Program Activities

   A. Travel-Where’ve You Been/Where’re You Going?
     1. SXSW
        a. Dianne (film and interactive) panel was great (except for one panelist).  Good feedback.  
           *Indiegogo party-so many people; most not artists.  We should host parties in the future.
        b. Natale (music) mint tins went out.  Music not best way to spend time and money.  Fewer attendees for panels/sessions.  Musicians there to see music, not go to sessions.  
           *Interactive and Film the place to be! How do we fit into that?  Would it make sense to sponsor a music performance? We should look at films and ask if we can throw their premier party at SXSW.   
           * Austin Creative Alliance-new ED knows people at SXSW and wants to co-host panels, parties, etc.
     2. Houston went well.  Met with Houston endowment.  Space Taker is great host.  
     3. Chicago: 1st 2-day EXPO.  We can go back to sending one person.  Not enough people to have 2 people there for 2 days.  
         a. CAAC not a great turn out.   
         b. Jean Ann take aways: need better pitch for us.  Difficult to tell who we are without knowing what they do and what they’re interested in.   Good turn out.  Session was better than going to table.  Having a presence is good for other orgs to see.  Make sure we have a session.
     4. Atlanta: Disorganized.  
        a. Juliana: 20-25 engaged people-went well. 
        b. Emily: 4-6 people attended.  2 insurance underwriters attended.  Too early in the morning.  Not worth going to.   You do not meet many people-only those who come to your session.  Very little interaction, unengaged staff.  South Arts and Alternate Roots impromptu meetings.  Chatted about ArtsReady.   Contact there quit to work on film.  
     5. Philly: Went well.  Should consider doing these happy hours if 2 people go; partner in city to co-host.  Use mail chimp-decide how far people would be willing to drive.  If we want to do this, we should plan it out well and in advance so that it is strategic and intentional.  T-shirts with tour dates?

Half of the meeting talked about branding and perception

Dianne sending edited version of this list to Tim and Adam

Plan is to have further meetings that will focus on single items in the list.

Publicist interviews, waiting for 2 proposals

Great Nonprofits, have people


**Ask the ED **

anything you’re working on in particular?

Not really!

Ian moving to Washington is a positive with our goals with Future of Music Coalition

Helen Gruner, supporter of FMC, convening a meeting of largely funders and other people in her circle to talk about collaboration with us and FMC

On the lookout for cultural policy ideas here in NYC that would potentially be a rallying point for the community and might be a vehicle for us to work with folks in city government. Looking for a signature issue. Criteria for a good idea – local, ideally something that we could make the case that it’s potentially relevant to other citites, and something that is interesting but simple enough to be a real rallying point for people in the field.

Discipline specific issues?

Open to it, but broader is better.

Any blind alleys you’re walking down?

We talked about space issues, that’s a constant rallying point. Gentrification – keeping people in the neighborhood by keeping the artists there, business partnerships that support the artistic community.

How do you make economic growth happen?

Commercial space for artists – how can the city support it?

Citywide or Brooklyn Lots of travel this month!

Recap some trips that may or may not have been interesting…

APASO, mostly theater and performing arts alliances throughout the country We presented on technology and Adam did a panel on individual artists Any broad strokes takeaways? Lot of them are freaked out about money and large institutions closing. Their member organizations and the service orgs. Meeting a bunch of potential artful.ly resellers Heard a lot about project audience – seems like a lot of people have bought into it, doesn’t seem to have a lot of management focus. Still haven’t really shown what project audience will do

Lisa went to DC for a community design session Clear articulation of what visual artists need out of their space Film really fits in performing arts model Excited about organized searchable database of technology Federal buildings are a particular issue, certain spaces have security issues and also historic buildings have special circumstances.

Arts Advocacy Day, Emily Huge majority of downstate New York representatives Different experiences with different congresspeople – not too hard to convince NY congresspeople to support the arts Not a lot of cross pollenation in terms of geographic diversity American for the Arts does a great job of preparing materials. Lot of college students there, lot of midcareer professionals working in a NFP arts org 3 main talking points, restore NEA to 2 years ago money for arts education congressional arts caucus smaller issues – more interesting to us? White space, tax incentives, etc. maybe could throw a party after arts advocacy day? Could make a bigger deal out of the fact that we’re there.

Tim went to Vancouver Meetings on how to use data and revolutionize philanthropy through data People involved in social enterprise and entrepreneurship Interesting group of people. Took away – different way of looking at what we’re doing. Positions us differently by tapping into these networks. Fruitful to go to some of these gatherings. Tim was the only person from the cultural sector.

Baltimore, Pittsburgh – Selena Wide topic on enhanced patron records in Baltimore Event co-hosted by Robert W. Deutsch foundation, trying to establish selves as an arts funder Gemini UI guy is coming

Then Selena and Adam Natale are going to Pittsburgh. Hosted by Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council South Dakota, Tim and Gary going to South Dakota for Davos institute Talking about managing and using your data One of 5 groups presenting.

Austin – Adam going to Austin National Arts Strategies chief executive program UT Austin, the “New Nature of Money.”

Adam Natale headed to New Orleans Sweet Home New Orleans – lot of independent musicians in NOLA Artfully workshop, individual artists workshop, culture guy at the mayor’s office

Denver – Create Denver expo, Dianne is going

Last Thursday and Friday of the month, National Network of Fiscal Sponsors meeting is taking place. Juliana and Adam are taking part in the meeting.

June 13, having a Fiscal Sponsorship information session in NYC at Wicks Lounge. Stop doing webinars in the summer. Wicks space is cool. Adam did a session there last night. Open to having other events there, it’s free. Spaces or Artful.ly could consider the space.

Health Insurance positioning, Emily

the point is not, “Fractured Atlas doesn’t do health insurance.”

Please send anyone with questions to Emily

In general,

Everything is still available when we were facilitating direct enrollment on ehealthinsurance. Don’t have to be a member. Never facilitated enrollment in group plans, even though people think we did. Still very much active and engaged in that space, just shifting our priorities to make sure we are best serving the membership. Not an ehealthinsurance program. Not necessary to mention ehealthinsurance, we have a partnership with them. User friendly self service tool on our website, staff is available to help with questions.

Tim has things to mention:

Next Wednesday, first visiting professional. Arbitron, General Foods. Part of 2 technology startups. Serves on the board of Welch’s. Just Q&amp;A. Wondering if there are any things to ask him

Really big deal that Tim is getting these people to do this We should be thoughtful about how to make the most out of this Adam has some questions about marketing and branding

Summer Fridays:

Full time staff member, work a full Friday between memorial and labor day, can accrue a half vacation day.

Have to let Tim know if you work a full day.

Otherwise, office closes at 2.

Added into the pool that is eligible to be swept forward, so you get a third of however many days you have at the end of summer Friday time.</field>

ACTION ITEMS 

Emily is leading brainstorm on 25k member party, she'll send an e-mail.

Ongoing FB/Twitter tags- one featured artist tagged per day- speak to Nathan

Search one missing congressional district that does not represent any of our members

Check out PKPR's website, they are our new publicity consutant firm.

We should be talking more as Organization wide definition of CDS in terms of our Fractured Atlas brand.

Emerging Leader In The Arts Award- Adam Natale!

Think about questions for our upcoming visiting professional series. Tim will send around more about Carol McFate's work history so that we can form questions as well as next month's VP.

Summer Party to be planned.



FMC UPDATE Adam H gave an overview of upcoming FMC event. (Adam and Ian attending) The event will be more of a strategy/brainstorm conversation.

Next Step: A feasibility study to see if the concept an institute is viable. RFP has been sent out.

Ask the ED: 25K member party? noted: actual stats are different on the website because they are weighted, there is also an attrition rate based on the members we lose simultaneously.

Should this be internal or external? Not sure. There will be more discussion. Some thoughts: If its public, we could involve our OAN partners via satlite? Offer free membership for everyone that is 25? Or just get drunk together?

Cultural Policy Issue Ideas to present to Council Members.. no ideas at the moment, but Adam did toss out an idea of some kind of gov't support for artists or arts ors to buy real estate in neighborhoods where they have lived or worked for a long time. But of course its expansive and not scalable at the moment. Naturally Occurring Cultural Districts: term borrowed from urban planning. A model alternative to gentrification. But people behind this movement are not very politically pragmatic.

PROGRAM UPDATES 1. Twitter/FB tags- Featured Artists of the Day Nathan is tweeting on one featured FS project per day. Lots of FB likes but no click He is making sure it is diverse by geographically and discipline

Trying to make it about people that have events coming up, but we should also connect this somehow to artists that are using Artful.ly

We may want to give artists a heads up so that they can gear up their social media networks to capitalize on these tags.

Ultimately the hope is to expand attention to artists using other programs. Maybe it would be better to feature an artist for a whole week. A lot easier than something new each day. This also gives the members more time to rally behind the idea that they are featured.

New Marketing Firm Hired 2.PKPR. They have a lot of great clients that have a crossroads of technology and culture. google them, and check out their website.

Right now they are gathering info about all of our programs, and whats on deck. Notably Emily spoke with them today about our work on the affordable healthcare act. But they will be speaking with all program directors, and working with Tim on general member stats and strategy.

They have great connections to press in tech, entrepreneurial, and culture realms.

TRAVEL

South Dakota (Tim and Gary) Convening of arts/fundraising/marketing sector experts, focusing on technology. Poverty in SD is notable. A lot of start up arts development plans, such as repurposing spaces for arts related use.

Baltimore/Detroit/Pittsburg (Selena) Community Design Sessions CRM Features Learned that people need surgical list/reporting functionality. Something that we don't have but is a high priority

E-mail and export functionality

Mixed feedback about social media. Twitter trumps Facebook? People want to use social media integrated with CRM strategically but don't know how, there may be an opportunity here for us.

How can we capitalize on CDS to communicate that we are the good guy in terms of developing arts technology. And make it part of the FA Brand.

Business Plan Consultants- hired to work on plan for Artful.ly. Draft of plan has been submitted and we are working with them on a revision. This will be helpful to us internally, and will help creditbitliy with funders- An accessible lens for understanding Artful.ly.

ON THAT NOTE Big Important Idea: Focus for the next yr or so- focus on Artful.ly as opposed to Athena, and our existing constituency as opposed to new business. This is our market. Analysis of member survey and cross ection of how many events are ticketed per yr by members- money we could make is compelling. This will buy us time to make the functionality that will attract commercial ors.

Ian- Attended mtg- Animating Democracy Work in the Arts that have social change as some part of their goals. not too productive, but helped him wrap thinking around how to adapt various logic models See blog posts about Ian's work with Arts Wave.

Natale- Americas for The Arts- getting award!

Chorus America conference (Ian Emily) Bringing new Opera Pocket Guides Ian moderating talk

Games For Change Conference (Dianne)

Dance USA (Emily/Tim)

National Assoc of Teachers of Singing NATS (Emily)

Gather Altanta (Lisa)

Grant Makers in the Arts- publishing an article about Ian.

Visiting Professional Series Carol McFate this month Jack Waters- next month On Deck: Adams Dad Tim locking down others.

What is a good criteria for a VP? interesting work outside the arts field.

Carol- was on board for David Parsons. Lots of interesting work in the financial world, a very rich history in business.

Audit is complete, ask Tim if you have questions

Finance Report.

Tim is considering rotating staff meeting chairs.

 - Alex has drafted a new version and it has been presented to the board. Benefited from their informed but more distanced perspective.

- Shoutout to blogging from FS team – good stuff
- Pipeline chart, projects within – pre-pipeline, planning, prototyping, scaling – any questions, ask Adam
 - Book in pre-pipeline: distillation of how we talk about arts management the Fractured Atlas way – Emily is working/has been working on this, very much in pre-planning stage
- As of Sept 1, Lisa and Selena are officially Program Directors!

**Ask the ED**

- Did we make the 11 million mark? Almost!
- What's the status with PKPR? They’ve hit the ground running, we haven’t gotten any huge stories yet, but some good virtual ink on a few things. Happy with speed and their deep/accurate understanding of our work. Adam would like to do even more with this.
- What is our relationship with the Creative Coalition and can we better inform them? Creative Coalition = movie stars who want lobbyists to speak out for them in DC. Unimpressed with depth of their policy advocacy etc. As we become more active in DC, there will be more opportunities to engage with them.
- Where does Fractured U fit into the pipeline? Pipeline is specifically about new program development, not so much development of existing programs. We need to determine if/how we are moving forward with Fractured U – could add it to pipeline if it diverges substantially.
- How is IRS Audit going? Hopefully, we are nearing the end, but we never know. There is one outstanding IDR related to Gemini restructuring. Adam is drafting response, needs review from attorney before sending it off. It’s possible this is the last one. Cautiously optimistic that they’ve concluded their inquiry into FS and Insurance.

- Program Activities:

**Travel – Where we all goin’? (Any Staff)**


- On the calendar: Blue things = places we’re going, Green = FA events, Red = deadlines
- Ian and Adam going to Boston in a couple weeks for research team mtg with folks at Harvard – IFSAA = new acronym for Initiative For Sustainable Arts in America. We are contracted by Harvard.
- Lisa is going to LA on the 25th for SpaceFinder LA - are there any OAN members we could reach out to about this?
- Tim is going to Annual Philadelphia Creative Cultural Alliance
- Baltimore – mtg with all partners at Maury, Donnelly, and Parr to work out partnership issues
- Nathan is going to NYU
- Brooklyn Flea Sept 15 and 22!

**The Fractured Atlas member holiday party **(aka Winter Warmer) will be at Third Ward on December 15

**Credit Union Update**

- Jillian is on board to co-facilitate - she and Juliana are meeting weekly
- Planning to reach out to some people in the sector and do some more research before we engage publicly with this
 - In preparation/education/research phase
- Need to re-evaluate/adjust goal dates/milestones, and nail down why we are working on this project
 - Right now, mission impact and strategic value are pretty clear, but financial imact feels fuzzy
- Lisa would like to join the steering committee

**Dance NYC -** Ian - first research report commissioned from Fractured Atlas

- first study that's really looked at Fiscal Sponsorship in depth - presentation at 92 St. Y 9/7 at 6pm
 - clarifies raison d'etre of Fiscal Sponsorship - very exciting/groundbreaking stuff!

**Fiscal Sponsorship newsletter is going out next week to Fiscally Sponsored Projects **- will be issued once a month

 - Need to give a little more love to that – Amanda will work on this also

 - Possibly some shows cancelled - issues with Artful.ly
 - It was hart to keep up with customer service - definitely a backup
- Response to Sandy blog post? Not a ton of response - some were very grateful - response was positive but not huge
 - Adam struggled with what an appropriate response could have been - there wasn't anything really, really substantive we could offer
 - Annual report deadline was extended - people really appreciated this
 - We might consider implementing a different severe weather plan - specifically, the issue of working from home, and making ourselves less location dependent
- How are the internal and IRS audits going?

 - Every year we try to anticipate their questions/what they might need - we did a good job with of doing that this year

### Program Activities:


**Past Travel**



- Health 2.0 - Lots of information disseminated - some was pertinent and helpful, but mostly it was just interesting to hear what's happening in the field
 - Didn't come away with lots of great connections - it was kind of a meat market for programmers and people looking to buy companies. Not a great place for an arts nonprofit
- NAS Finance - Jillian, Dianne, and Tim in Minneapolis - 2 days talking about creating value/managing risk, TONS of info
 - Some good things came out of this - good to meet with other organizations, and learn more about their organizations/systems/structures
 - Definitely recommend others to go to future seminars - we should take advantage of future offerings - very valuable/substantive content
- GIA - Ian, Adam, and Dianne in Miami Beach
 - Fractured Atlas/our work was represented on 4 different panels here - first time we'd been on panels, 3rd year attending conference. Panels went well - one was very controversial.

- Atlanta Foundation Center - Juliana attended - good meeting partner organizations
- Cuyahoga Arts Council - Ian glad he attended - on a grant panel that evaluates applications for grants up to $5000

- Yale - this went well! Invited Dianne to come back - presentation on crowdfunding

Chair: Amanda Keating, Notes: Ben Kaplan

### November Action Items:




- Tim and Adam to meet about board interaction—they met, and will see if there’s a possibility to tack something on before the board meeting. Next meeting will probably be January 17th. Much easier to end the meeting early.
- Jillian, Dianne, Tim, and Adam to meet to discuss NAS Finance conference – how can we apply what they learned to FA? –felt strongly about providing whole staff with greater visibility of the financial mechanics of the organization
- Looking into possibility of CSA – Adam and Dianne to discuss this? – Dianne is doing this on her own. It’s going to be a second tier of FS, and this is the test run. This is for larger projects that are infrastructure focused. Juliana will help manage the second tier eventually. This will be closer to traditional FS, and under this model, project fully owned and integrated into sponsor, and sponsor provides back office support.
- Southern Tour Update – still need connections in Louisville and Columbia—Gary found a great partner in Columbia, and we’ll do a workshop with them. Probably will go to Greensboro as well.
- Progress with Powerpoint: Emily to send it out with feedback— was sent to Emily this morning

Possibly the 13th.

### Ask the ED:


**Adam’s Report (10 minutes)**


- Adam wants to make sure that as FA expands, he stays in the trenches
- Wants to hear ideas directly, so once every few months, he will host a lunch with staff that do not report to him directly to talk about what we’re hearing from members, different aspects of FA, questions for him, etc. He will send out an email in the next few days with the first invites. Adam wants an open door policy, so as to facilitate communication
- Ian also wants to take out to lunch anyone who is in D.C.

 - Friday at 12:30 is weekly TG, everyone free to come. We can make a blue jeans meeting for people who want to join.

### Operations:

Want to steer clear of telling people we didn’t get back to them quickly b/c “we have 25,000 members”

- “I handle things in the order I receive them, and I’m responding as fast I can”- Dianne’s suggestion

Passed 25,000 member milestone!

**A. Financial**

- a. Account Schematic (see printout)
 - Doubled accounts in 4 years
 - Payment processing: authorize.net and Braintree used, since Chase doesn’t allow us to use artful.ly
 - Investment accounts where FS funds are held
 - FS Donation  Authorize.net (authorizes card)-&gt; merchant account -&gt;checking account /investment account
 - Jillian: we want more transparency in terms of how many transactions are taking place
 - Switch from First ACH to Chase to streamline the process
 - Should we look at our messaging, in terms of what our customers are seeing when there is an error message?
- b. Finance Report
 - We finished Q1 of the fiscal year
 - Seen solid growth in membership dues—might see some slowing or we’ve reached a saturation point (currently at 14%, though historically it’s been 23-25%)

 - Holiday Bonus—will be put on December 15th paycheck. It will be taxed. 401K contributions are involved as well

 - Tim can give a quick tutorial for those who don’t know how to use it
 - Chrome is better to use than other browsers-- also better than skype.

 - Please delete scan snap items!
- c. Supply Order Procedure
 - Please initial items you write on the board, in case Ben has questions

### Ask the ED

- Gary: we have a third round interview for new developer
- Talking about integrating artful.ly with FA to minimize confusion for members

**3.	Development**

- Typically, ratio to philanthropic dollars to earned revenue is 50/50, but FA is different (less than a third from contributions)
- We want to expand the base of support to include other sources (corporate individuals)
- Started with an appeal at the end of the year
 - we pulled from a list of 300 donors and sent out letters. 10 donors responded
 - we’ve had 75 donations from the end of the fiscal year to today
 - The goal is to develop a more regular habit of giving from donors
- Marie-Louise wants to build a major gifts program: $5,000 would be considered a major gift. She is generating a list of prospects
 - how are we going to let people in and let them know what we do?
 - a cultivation plan based around FA projects, events we can bring donors to meet our projects and say, “this project was made possible b/c FA made it happen”

**4.	Fiscal Sponsorship**

- still trying to balance enthusiasm for tier 2 with getting it launched off the ground
- tier 2: a more comprehensive FS project that provides more backend support
- Adam: we’re focused not on artists but on other infrastructure providers, to provide incubation for other service organizations. We have four good candidates now, three of which have budgets in excess of $500,000

**Yale Philanthropy Conference (Jason)**

- building the space between corporate and non-profit entities
- supporting social enterprises to maximize social impact
- New wave of philanthropy will be social impact investments—how can we leverage this?
- &quot;Instead&quot;- a micro philanthropy app, started as non-profit and went to for-profit to leverage capital
- What are social impact investments?
- Currently, in developing world, social enterprises are selling products (like medical products, water treatment), etc. taking a foundation’s investment portfolio and choosing to make a financial return on things that benefit the world

**Undoing Racism Workshop (Jason &amp; Jean Ann)**

- held by the People’s Institute
- It was great: 3 days long, but the time was very productive
 - walked away with a lens through which to view institutions
 - it was about ending racism, not about diversity, taking the want for diversity one step further, showing how racism is a construct in institutions
- gave tools for an analysis of who we worked with, in terms of socio-economic status
- is neutrality inherently racist because it supports the status quo?
 - perpetuating a status quo perpetuates a racist system
 - Ideas: the switch over to EFT: necessitates having a bank account. If you have a criminal record, it may be more difficult to get a bank account, and in communities of color, there might be a higher prevalence of criminal records—are we perpetuating racism?
 - Ian: a natural bias of capitalism, that the status quo is often the most efficient. Therefore, there is a concentration of resources towards people who fit the definition of “normal,” and it would cost more money to serve those considered out of the “normal” curve.
 - Did the workshop provide tools to prioritize?
 - A power analysis? Where does power flow in the organization?
- Adam: How do you balance financial costs with ethical costs? Our mission is to support artists regardless of color, but also to support as many artists as possible
- Jillian: Should we get in touch with Christine Bader to help us form this group?

### III.	Operations (15 minutes)

- We are closed President’s day
- Program specialist nearing end of search, developer nearing end of search, 200 apps for program associate

Full Staff Meeting Thursday, March 7, 2012 12:00 -1:00PM 

Minutes: Ben

### March Action Items

- Send Marie-Louise ideas for cultivation events!!!
- Southern Tour recap? (Dianne and Selena)
- Send Spaces staff ideas for new venue listings for artist run spaces (particularly dance or movement based work)
- Discuss attending the American Association for Museums Conference

### February Action Items

- Send Marie-Louise ideas for cultivation events-- this still needs to happen. Please send to Marie-Louise. She wants to build an event for lots of potential donors. **We could piggyback on something our members are already doing. Do we have members who would be willing to do a performance, a private show for potential donors?
- Forward customer service emails to import@helpdesk.fracturedatlas.org- Jean Ann has been doing this. So has Juliana. Solved!
 - Ian: should inquiries about Archipelago be forwarded to this as well? Adam says no.
- Identify power users and tag them. Make a note in the CRM saying why they're great!- This hasn't been happening. Where does the power user tag live?
 - Adam: you can tag the customer record itself.
 - Juliana: can we search by stars and flags? Can we create a power user badge? Adam: not a bad idea.
- Set up a monthly meeting to discuss racism (Jean Ann and Jason)
 - Jean Ann and Jason met in February to debrief about the responses they got. They plan on doing monthly meetings going forward. There's also a funding opportunity with the Nathan Cummings Foundation.
- Follow Dianne and Selena on the Southern Tour! Be ready for a recap (Tim)- they had a great time, they got upgraded to a convertible.
- Take a look at the weekly stand-up on the wiki. Ask Tim if you have questions. - Some people have been looking at it.
 - Adam: if you're not in the meeting and you're curious about what's happening, ask questions about it.
- Tim is scheduling an hour-long Competing Values Slice &amp; Dice-- This totally happened.

### Agenda


### Ask the ED

- Ian: can you give us an update on NAS?
 - There is nothing to report. We haven't had further meetings because of their travel schedule. Our next meeting is scheduled for the first week of April.
- Jason: any further news about FMC (Future of Music Coalition)?
 - We're getting to the no-go point of that collaboration. Initially conceived as opening a research and policy institute in D.C. centered around arts and technology policy. Maybe will still try and address one or two issues, possibly about technology helping with distribution. The conversations have been difficult b/c both sides already have other things going on (our conversation with NAS, for example). FMC is also pursuing their own strategic planning process. We will probably know more next month.
- Nathan: Do you have thoughts on our membership growth slowing?
 - There is one number that I look at on the membership stats page: the number of Full members (Individual and Organizational), and that's been going up consistently over the past few months. There may be some seasonality associated with this as well. This is not at the stop of the list of worries.
- Alison: what's at the top of the list of worries? Where are the struggles right now?
 - Worrying that we're still projecting a six figure deficit for the year. This is something we can weather, but it still sucks. Also concerned about different programs in different ways. FS is the most robust and healthy, but also faces the most existential threats beyond our control. (IRS rules or a shift to a more crowdfunding related model). With Arful.ly the concern is finding good engineers.
 - Also worry about culture. As we grow, it becomes harder and more important to hold on to the good things about FA identity (smart, irreverent, accessible, etc.)
- Juliana: have you heard back from Greg about the TIER 2 operating agreement?
 - we essentially have a final draft for the agreement


### Program Reports


**Archipelago**


- new program specialist: Alison Conard! She's pretty awesome, and will be helping us take this program to the next level. We're starting off with some pressing items from the Initiative for Sustainable Arts in America
- pedal to the medal with new interface design
- starting with integration with the Foundation Center to get their grants data in the system

- we're getting a ton of E&amp;O policies, which makes us a lot of money

**Research**
- interesting opportunities: grant app into the NEA
- also discussions with the New York Community Trust
- a collaboration with Dance NYC in the summer
- Calgary Arts Development-- Ian has been invited to be an outside reader of materials coming up, offering advice, etc.

**Spaces**
- big pivot in the Spaces program: moving away from share my calendar and towards premium listings (search engine optimization), to see if people want to advertise through spaces or not
- trying to explode the number of people listing spaces. trying to get 2000 spaces to 5000

### Travel Report

- presentation at the Creative Chicago Expo, which was very welcomed
- CAC
- Valentine's Party: we had 150-200 people, pretty successful. Can we do a better job of helping them get started with us?
 - is there a way for us to teach people about crowdfunding, FS, etc., to do more direct outreach?
- Adam was in LA last week for meeting with Power to Give folks
 - possible collaboration for open source crowdfunding platform for the arts? We will know more next month. They are coming to New York and then we have a meeting with the Ford Foundation
- American Association for Museums Conference in May-- is anyone thinking of going?
 - Adam: a good idea, a completely untapped, large swath of the field.

### Operations

- Finance Report
 - We've completed the audit and 990!
 - we should be at 50% by this point (since we're halfway through the fiscal year)

- Ian: is our board going to change from a brain board to a pockets board?
 - there may be some additional structure of governance in place if we start to go after pockets. At the moment, people are not there for their ability to give but for their brainstorming/brainpower capabilities
 - MLS: would like to see the board do more capacity building, perhaps something separate from our brain trust
- What is our current annual ask for the board?
 - $750 is the current minimum, but Adam thinks it should be greater, and for most people it is

Full Staff Meeting Thursday, May 2, 2013 12:00-1:00PM

### April Action Items


- Email Dianne about interest in the writing group—this happened. First meeting was good, led by Ian. Wrote exercise in response to prompt. Adam will help with the next one. We will be refining boilerplate.
- Contact Jean Ann with ideas for new insurance markets and outreach- Lisa did it!
- Send Lisa ideas for new community directories
 - Update: Jason connected us to the union in three cities
- Set up voting for Internet Week New York- we set it up but we didn’t win : (. They are giving us two passes that we can pass around

### May Action Items

- Set up next writing group (with Adam)
- Check out the new Artful.ly!
- Pilot project proposals for PA and PS

### Agenda

- Adam is writing a “Don’t follow your dream, find your mission” article
- Dianne: what’s happening with PKPR? How are we evaluating their effectiveness?
 - Tim: trying to educate reporters for first six months. Stories that got a lot of play were featuring Adam as a thought leader. We’re still doing stories about Spaces launch, Artful.ly, but also continuing to feature Adam. Reporters will then know to call him for questions. Hopefully we will start to land in bigger and bigger publications in the next 6-12 months.
 - Alex Vargas (board) advised us to look at a 12-18 month timeline for this

### Ask the ED

- Can you go through your schedule? (Tim)
 - Sundance for NAS final gathering (two weeks) May 12th-16th
 - Vacation last week of June and first week of July
 - Out of the office and off the grid for the month of August, in anticipation of formal sabbatical next year
- What about updating website copy?
 - right now there is no content management system, so this is a huge project
- What about financial management during that time?
 - this will go to Tim
 - part of the goal is to identify what things we need Adam for, and how to make the organization able to function when he's out of the office
- NAS? Audit?
 - almost done with the audit! “it’s like a box of candy”
 - NAS meeting: two issues came up:
 - is the intention to do a merger, or just to do work together? Need to have a specific project, because that will determine what kind of collaboration happens
 - hit a major roadblock in regard to senior leadership (particularly in the CEO position). They are committed to a shared leadership model, and Adam doesn’t think that would work.
- What types of collaborations are you thinking of?
 - Everything from incremental extensions of work (let’s have a consulting practice! Not a side project, but one combined team) to crazy ambitious ideas for crowd-sourced philanthropy
- Any other news in mergers, acquisitions, likes, friendships?

- Anything on Gemini?
 - We’ve been looking at absorbing Gemini into Fractured Atlas, where we would hire their four key people as FA employees and dissolve Gemini as an independent entity (we would save money on development for Artful.ly, Archie, etc. This would help with maintenance, building up consulting business, etc.)
 - Adam is currently working with tax lawyers to see how to structure it, so as not to incur the wrath of the IRS
 - Program directors should project budgets based on the current model

Full Staff Meeting

Thursday, July 11, 2013 12:00‐1:00PM

### Action Items for July


- recruit artists to attend July 18th event
- prepare customer service issues for quarterly meeting
- send suggestions to Lisa for artist-run dance spaces
- check out Selena's Artful.ly one-sheet-- can we use this as a template for other programs?
- send requests to Adam before hermitage
- email Alison about specific questions related to Archie

### Action Items for June

- EFT sign-up forms-- did we punt on this? Dianne- we're doing this
- Per Diem requests- Tim assume if you needed to do this, you did

### Welcome Gemini!

- executing paperwork with lawyers and accountants-- June 16th was the date when this went into effect
- Adam is working on copy for consulting services that are being rebranded under FA

**Questions?**

- Is it a program?
 - Yes, and it's called &quot;Custom Software Development&quot;
 - Gemini projects have historically ranged from 25,000-75,000 dollars
 - This is not a mass-market service
 - If it's Artful.ly related, talk to Selena first
 - If it's something else (content management system, online interface for arts festivals, etc.)--&gt; Adam or Shawn
 - We want leads, but quality, appropriate leads, so check in with Adam and Shawn
- Are members of the NNFS eligible to be clients, even if they're not in the arts/culture sector?
 - We will prioritize arts and culture, will take into account our limited bandwidth, but be open to potential leads
- Will there be a contact person on the website?
 - es, still figuring that out, but will probably be Adam or Shawn

### Ask the ED

- 37signals article created a lot of buzz about customer service response times. Can you elaborate? Do we have a plan to meet some of these goals?
 - Mistake to read between the lines about what Adam is saying, Adam is not going to throw down the gauntlet. We should be challenged to think about this stuff. It was intended to spur discussion and analysis about the way we approach customer service
 - This will be discussed further at our quarterly customer service meeting
- Adam is taking his &quot;hermitage&quot;, so he will not be at the next staff meeting
 - Focusing on things that makes him less of a chokepoint or single point of failure, making small things self-service
 - Adam will be out of contact, so Tim or Shawn will be the points of contact
- We're not merging with anyone in the near future, are we?
 - No, NAS is on hold indefinitely it appears
- Eight staff members working in seven different states, so we will have a September get-together

### Program Activities

**Spaces**
- spotlight on space initiative, funded by Mertz, targeting artist managed spaces, 68 live-synced calendars for dance spaces-- check out The Woods Cooperative
- still need to add more artist-run dance spaces

**Fiscal Sponsorship**

- working on getting systems in place for Tier II CSA (merchant acct, bank acct, etc.)
- developing advanced webinars for grants (corporate and gov't)
- research on donations by text?
- Artful.ly users are also interested in donations by text
- Jason: when is Tier II going to be public? How will it affect our messaging? - we don't have a specific date, and want to have a project on board before we start promoting it
- &quot;Innovation Incubator&quot;- name for the Tier II program. it's part of FS, so it's not a new program

**Development**

- so thrilled about Leila!
- plan to target individuals and major donors
- major deadlines for DCA and NEA in August
- new round of LOIs to institutional donors
- Cultivation event- let's focus on impact more than the mechanisms we use to achieve the impact

**Artful.ly**
- one-sheet to understand Artful.ly- talking points!
- launch in the fall-- use the talking points!
- Selena will schedule a meeting with front lines staff
- one-sheet is an internal doc, so use accordingly

- NNFS- services for members
- DigiPop- wrapping up
- Clean-up work for Dance USA, complete redesign of homepage and website
- National Center of Homeless Education-- will be wrapped up soon
- Is there an application process for software within the organization?
- Shawn will spend 20% of his time on FA site maintenance
- We don't work with individuals, but with organizations. Generally they have enough of a budget to get the most out of the consulting services

**Insurance**

- Health insurance: stop date has been extended to March 1st. (due to budget and concerns about what will happen to our members' policies)
- Health insurance resources will also eventually be off the website
- We're still known as a company that offers health insurance to artists, so we want to clarify that we no longer have that as a program

**Archie**
- roping in Sustain Arts, and it looks like that's going to happen. Intermediary deliverable by the end of August
- Detroit launches in December(?)
- Bay Area is next in terms of Sustain Arts

**Travel**


- new travel schedule will be up soon
- Juliana is headed to Alternate Roots next month (Nashville)

### Operations

- Quarterly good-neighborly reminder: clean up the conference room after parties
- floater power cables-- let's keep them together

**Finance report**

- we have a month and a half left
- we probably won't meet our budget goal for membership fees or healthcare
- August 1st- trying to get new health insurance plans for staff-- be on the lookout
- Jillian will email ticket allowances.

TRG contract with Ian has gone through!

Full Staff Meeting

Thursday, June 6, 2013 12:00-1:00PM

### June Action Items

- July 18th cultivation event

### Agenda

- Strategic Priorities Memo
 - Adam appreciated everyone who took the time to write their thoughts and response- board appreciated it as well
 - are there aspects of it that are unclear, things that didn’t make sense?
 - what about priorities from last year that didn’t make it to this year?
 - this doesn’t mean we don’t want to work with large organizations, for example, but it’s just lower on the list now
- Eating our data driven dog food- is there a timeline?
 - There isn’t a destination, it’s a virtue we aspire to as an org, having good processes and skills at the individual level for thinking about challenging questions in this way
 - Ian has been working on stuff related to this
 - This priority was prompted by Ian’s proposal to Adam, and may see some first stabs in the next few months
- MLS: framing of strategic questions was really helpful, but how do we roll out vision and priorities for a longer timeframe?
 - this may be on the horizon, may make sense to do a longer map-out for a specific issue. We don’t want to become constrained by a blueprint
- Do we need to complete these priorities by the end of the half-year?
- We do not. You should keep these things in mind and try to make progress on them today. And tomorrow.
 - How do we attack these priorities in a way that a) doesn’t cost $100,000 and b) doesn’t take 20hrs of Adam’s time?
 - Are these a bunch of “ideas” vs. a bunch of “perspectives” and “trends”?
- What task forces? Should we separate a marketing task force from a membership task force?

### Ask the ED

- Is the conversation with NAS dead?
 - It’s still in a holding pattern for now
 - We will still be looking for opportunities with them
- Gemini update?
 - We have most of the guidance from legal counsel
 - Adam has asked the executive committee to approve it ASAP- projected date is June 15th for Gemini people coming in.
 - We are still going to work out the practical issues (resource allocation, etc.
- Rundown of Gemini Staff:
 - Shawn Anderson- project manager, will do some maintenance/programming on the FS site
 - Dan Porter- Gemini’s lead developer, based outside of Portland
 - Mauricio (Michigan)- engineering, some user-interface
 - Chap Ambrose (Austin, TX), heavy on design/user interface
 - This only works on a financial level if FA does a decent amount of web development for other companies
- Are they going to remain a unit together, or will they be working with Gary, Clinton a lot?
 - not sure yet, somewhere in between. Goal is to have a full-time person for Artful.ly
- Is there an update on USA projects?
 - USA projects board decided to go with someone else
 - Power2Give and FA are still considering a partnership – meeting on 17th of June

OkTECHberfest 2013 ‐‐ Full Staff Meeting

Tuesday, September 10, 2013 2:00‐3:00PM

###  September Action Items


- Find Lisa a Spaces Marketing Fellow
- Check out the website for Culture Works
- Send travel itineraries to travel@fracturedatlas.org
- Formalize system for notarized documents and signatures (for when Adam is away)

- Continue to send Lisa ideas for artist‐run dance spaces
- Send Leila outreach materials for Philadelphia Puppetry Festival

### Agenda

Welcome to OkTECHberfest 2013!

**I. Adam Huttler(15 minutes)**

**A. Fractured Atlasʹs Compensation Structure**

- Tim and Adam have been hearing more questions about the tiered salary structure based on position
- Amy (from our board) suggested we switch to a tiered system- switch happened in 2005-6
- The lesser of two evils, ensuring that people who do basically the same work get basically the same compensation
- What about acquiring new staff at a for-profit rate?
 - Software developers are paid a certain amount in the field, and we have to meet this rate in order to remain competitive
- What about creating new tiers?
 - If there is a meaningful way to distinguish between the expectations and responsibilities of the two jobs, Adam is open to creating new tiers. However, the idea would be to maintain a relatively flat organizational structure
- Do the rates ever get adjusted?
 - This was done several years ago over the course of three years. Rates were set as targets and 33% was completed each year.
- How do you compete with for-profit? Do you adjust salaries based on other non-profits?
 - The trick is to understand who your competitors are. Kickstarter and NYFA are both our competitors, and it doesn’t really matter whether one is for-profit and one is non-profit.

**B. Ask the ED**

*How was Delaware?*
- It was great, and shockingly productive. Having the space away from email was disorienting at first but great. Made Adam think about how to carve out time—because he felt 3x more productive.
- Gary: it taught Selena and I to be more self-reliant.
- Leila: it was difficult to figure out notarized documents and signatures without consulting with Adam first- can we formalize a system for doing this in the future?
- Ian: working on the NEA stuff was both more stressful and more empowering.
- Alison: in this stage of a program’s life cycle, where a tiny change can have a huge impact, it’s more important to have Adam’s feedback

MLS: Adam’s position gives him a perspective no one else has, so having his feedback is vitally important

What are your expectations with having everyone here in town?
- Mostly want to strengthen rapport, understand each other better, develop shorthand with each other, and get a better perspective on the whole scope of the organization’s activities.

### II. Program Activities


**1. Fiscal Sponsorship (Juliana)**
- Innovation incubator project is off the ground
- Webinars have started again in the fall, FS chats in December and over the summer
- Two new webinars: one on corporate funders, one on gov’t grants

**2. Advisory Services / Research (Ian)**
- Hour-long meeting on data-driven dog food on Thursday- will discuss then

**3. Insurance (Jean Ann)**
- Raised binder fees on insurance policies: $100 for base, renewals now $60, $50 on volunteer accident policies

**4. Spaces (Lisa)**
- Marketing fellow for Spaces?
- Article in the village voice about spaces helping artists priced out

**5. Development (Marie‐Louise)**
- MLS will be here for another year!
- We will focus on shifting emphasis from solely earned revenue to an organization with philanthropic support

**6. Archipelago (Ian)**

- Delivering first visualizations for the new version of Archie as part of the Sustain Arts Project

**8. Software Consulting (Shawn)**

- Work with the New World Symphony- Oct 1st should have great new version of their site
- Booked solid for the next three to six months- so don’t send Shawn any more new work!
- Culture Works?- check out their website

### III. Operations 

**A. Finance Report **

**B. Voice of Fractured Atlas **

**C. Social Media Report (Jason)**
- Infographic was received well: 700 reach points on Facebook
- Social media increased %754 more percent (for a week)!
- We didn’t see higher rates of likes, so figuring out how to convert users
- Alison: is there a repository for ideas for social media posts?

**D. Secret Santa Birthday Explained (Theresa)**

Full Staff Meeting

Thursday, October 3rd, 2013 12:00-1:00PM

### October Action Items

- Find Lisa a Technology Marketing Fellow (see description she sent)
- Email Selena if you’re interested in helping at the Artful.ly launch party (October 21st)
- Send Dianne 5-6 ideas for “Artist-Entrepreneurs of the Year”
- Email Leila about vendors for a projector rental
- If you voted 'no' to the homepage video, email Adam feedback
- Put “The Advantage” on your reading list- Tim has copies floating around
- Find a location for November off-sites

### September Action Items

- Find Lisa a Spaces Marketing Fellow- Lisa hasn’t sent the description to the staff yet, but we’ll have the final draft today
- Check out the website for Culture Works- it’s gorgeous!
- Send travel itineraries to travel@fracturedatlas.org- we’re trying to figure out how to not double-book things, so this is a way for Jason to keep everything organized
- Formalize system for notarized documents and signatures (for when Adam is away)- we have not done this yet. Tim sent Alanna the feedback from Adam’s hermitage, and we’re going to consider discussing this.

### Ask the ED


**Fractured U.**

- Adam has three major goals he would like to pursue with Fractured U.:
 - Keep what’s good about Fractured U.
 - Do it in a way that doesn’t allow it to deteriorate over time
 - Keep it at a budget of 10-15K a year
- It would be good to get Devon smith on social media, Tom Cott on marketing
- Who is managing this?
 - This is the biggest unanswered question. Two possibilities: 1. Someone on staff steps up and takes this on in addition to their responsibilities or 2. Find an outside consultant to manage the project
 - In the long term, if it’s a huge hit, Adam could imagine assigning half a PA position to it
- Is there a timeline for this all to go into effect?
- It would be for this fiscal year
- Would it be called the same thing? – Adam thinks so
- Why not monetize it? What about dividing it into free sections and other buy-in options?
 - Having any cost barrier will reduce uptake by 90% or more. Since our audience is much, much smaller than iTunes, for example, this would be impractical. There’s so much awesome free content out there it doesn’t seem that people would pay for it.
- Are we prioritizing name recognition over content?
 - This is not a requirement (name-recognition). Anyone on staff who will put in the work and can do a good job with it would be great.
- Could we have content for a curriculum that doesn’t fit the template?
 - The best way to do that would be for each video to have a “learn more” link that leads to Ted talks, other content, etc. It may make sense to have an “other educational resources” section of the site

### Program Activities

Fractured Atlas Member Video- does this work for the homepage?
- The majority said yes, but Adam wants

**Artful.ly Launch Party**

- Nothing is changing with Artful.ly, but we’re taking the beta tag off
- If anyone asks if Artful.ly is changing, the answer is no- the party is just an opportunity to celebrate
- 15-20 minutes of presentation with Artful.ly video, possibly members of ATC, and then we’ll have cocktails
- Target invite list has been funders, potential funders, current artful.ly users, etc.
- As we get response to our first invite group, we will open the invitations further
- Selena needs hands to help run the event
- There will be a live demo showcasing the app, so Selena could use help with that as well
- Check out the Artful.ly video at Artful.ly/about
- PKPR is doing an awesome job getting us some press- Fast Company online, Wall Street Journal, etc.
- Jason: Do we want social media support for this? – Selena is not sure of the timeline for the articles, so we will get more info from PKPR

**Insurance**

- Insurance had been in a bit of a financial slump and we decided to raise our binder fees, which is going very smoothly
- Also tried to counteract insistence by insurance companies that people fill out paper applications by having an online signature
- Healthcare fees are going away and VISA fees are on the agenda now

**Archipelago**

- Just delivered a milestone to Sustain Arts- probably a big check coming soon
- Stamen- has just put out their first release with real data- tons of fun
- Ian and Alison traveled to Utica, NY for a presentation of Archie, talked about cultural planning. They’re thinking of creating a cultural district in Utica- hopefully we’ll get to work with them in the future

**Software Consulting**

- Trying to deliver on our work for New World Symphony that’s fully functional, will work for users, and accessible on multiple devices
- Software development fellows- 3 months, plan to start at the beginning of the process by learning Ruby, Rails, and then move forward to a collaborative project
 - We already have two candidates
- What are the goals for the fellowship?
 - set up a pipeline for junior developers. Getting developers in has always been difficult, so it’s a great way to bring people in who are interested in the Fractured Atlas core mission but also interested in software development
- Jason: Are there legal stop gaps for blogging about our software development?
 - We would need to clear it with the customer first, but otherwise it shouldn’t be a problem
 - Alison: Stamen has a clause in their contract that lets them do just that
 - Adam: is it desirable to do this? It’s not a mass-market service, so we want to be careful about marketing a service to an audience that’s simply not appropriate for it
- Do we have a training program in mind for the fellowship?
 - Yes, and Shawn can give details for those interested in hearing more

**Fiscal Sponsorship**

- No longer going to have staff assigned to tasks- they’re going to be assigned to projects
- Adam is building functionality for auto-assigning tickets
- The idea is that staff members would be generalists

**Spaces**
- Spacefinder Detriot live- this happened
- Want to sync with Archie and Sustain arts so that quality of content is good
- Software challenges for international banking for Toronto- launch date is September 2014

**Development**

- Development team has been working with Jason and Ian to get TRG data for donor mailing
- Meeting with the Mellon foundation
- Meeting with the Ford Foundation coming up next month- one about national strategy for Spaces and the other for Power2Give
- Updated OAN membership can be found in the helpdesk now
- Dianne: should we be highlighting our members more broadly in advertising? “Artist-Entrepreneurs of the Year”
 - this could be a press thing- a great way to have cheap publicity
 - we could combine it with the “Top Ten Artist-Friendly Cities in America”
 - our own little MacArthur genius grant?

### Operations

**Finance Report**

- Swapped health insurance fees for Visa fees
- We’re on the hunt for new employee plans as of January 1st- Emblem health is not complying with the ACA, and is terminating our health insurance
 - Hopefully by the end of October, we will know what our options are
- Audit starts next week
 - Innovation incubator, Gemini acquisition, and fundraising are all new elements that need to be incorporated into the audit

**Staffing Update**
- Ben is switching over to the Development position October 15th
- Mauricio left to join a startup in Ann Arbor
- Fahad is leaving in November
- Two Admin Assistants will be starting October 15th

**&quot;The Advantage&quot;**

- The Fractured Atlas bible for at least the year.
- Addresses a lot of things like getting everyone on the same page, breaking down silos, focusing on organizational goals
- The Five Dysfunctions of a Team- previous book, available in prose and graphic novel format
- Senior staff will be doing quarterly off-sites starting in November

Full Staff Meeting

Thursday, November 6, 2013 12:00-1:00PM

### November Action Items

- Put The Advantage on your reading list, if you haven't done so already
- Complete the wellness survey from Jean Ann
- Complete the TRG Arts/Acxiom Data Verification Survey SurveyMonkey from Jason.
- When creating travel events: fill out event name, location, staff person who is going. So anyone else looking at the calendar can figure out what’s going on.
- Jason sent an email this morning with the directions for the communications calendar and protocol. Read and follow. Sproutsocial.com – everyone can get involved – install the bookmarklet to your bookmark bar.
- Keep things on the down-low that are not on the blog, public, etc. If unsure, ask. If not announced publicly, don’t talk about publicly. In particular, don't discuss the Ford grant app with Indiegogo, Rockethub and other fiscal sponsorship relationships.
- Submit electronic versions of receipts and be clear if it's a credit charge or reimbursement. If you're going to rename the receipt, rename with date of expense incurred. (i.e. 2013-11-06.Reimbursement)
- Ticket allowance: let Jillian know if you're buying a ticket for yourself or other people on staff.
- P.R.E.G.N.A.N.T. - remember everything that the acronym stands for and congratulate Jillian!!

### October Action Items

- Find Lisa a Technology Marketing Fellow – Yes!
- If you voted ‘no’ to the homepage video, email Adam feedback – feedback from naysayers helpful and consistent with Adam’s own concerns. We will get it up there; it will just take a little while.
- Put The Advantage on your reading list – copies floating around/ Jean Ann just finished the copy she had. Off-Site is on the 19th &amp; 20th with materials based on the book, and also team assessments, Myers-Briggs, etc.

### Welcome

3 software development fellows: Krista, Graham &amp; Christine and 2 AA’s: Justin &amp; Joyce. Fellows going through a structured learning process to beef up their skills. First time in FA history, 2 AA’s at the same time!

### Ask the ED

- Speaking of Fractured U – for inquirers, tell them to sit tight - doesn’t make sense to invest a lot of energy in something that is going to be overhauled. It is going to go away in its current format. Figure out what parts are really essential and re-do it in the new format.
- Adam’s big meeting with Ford today went great! Essentially have been invited to submit a proposal for a 500K grant. This seed money would move things from R&amp;D to prototype. Keep quiet from Indiegogo, Rockethub or if you’re involved with fiscal sponsorship-related matters. Ford is the last major funder to make an investment in FA. Timeline for this is likely 2014 into mid-2015.

### Program Activities


**Arts Entrepreneur Award (Dianne)**
- Dianne is not here so Jason talked about it – open call for artist for the awards, recognizing 5 artists and arts organizations that have innovated new business practices and/or developed novel solutions to old problems.
- Jason, Adam, Dianne, Tara and Theresa on the task force. Winners get recognition, maybe money and perhaps FA membership for life.
- Optimizing task forces. Timeline with a projected number of meetings, etc.

**TRG Arts/Acxiom Data Verification Survey (Jason)**

- How accurate is the data? As a test, we will complete a data verification survey on SurveyMonkey.

**Insurance (Jean Ann)**

- Working on being able to be a better provider for members in Louisiana because we’ve only been able to get them weird E&amp;S insurance. Bob is going to contract with a provider in Lousiana potentially that will expand our ability to provide good, not weird insurance to Louisiana
- Fill out wellness survey!

**Archipelago/Advisory Services/Research (Ian)**
- Busy month of traveling going to a non-arts conference was interesting on a number of levels. Gave keynote at education policy gathering – connecting research to strategy and decision making. We’re going to be able to have a 90 minute session at Americans for Arts about research-strategy-decision making.
- Just finishing up fiscal sponsorship study that Sarah’s been working hard on.
- Archipelago: trying to get it launched early spring. Detroit launch date is now March – the change really came from the Sustain Arts side.

**Software Consulting (Shawn)**
- Last month, we completed a major overhaul of the new world symphony’s virtual library. Got positive reviews from Michael Tilson Thomas! Accomplished initial goal though hey haven’t proceeded with a public launch yet – about to embark on an internal launch and hopefully will lead to a continued relationship b/w FA and New World Symphony.
- Will be moving out of active development for digipops (?)

**Fiscal Sponsorship (Juliana)**
- Annual reprts were due 10/31. The number of accounts frozen weren’t too bad.
- “Art Home” has come to us for fiscal sponsorship. Art Home helps artists with personal finace and asset building. This is happening now.

**Spaces (Lisa)**

- Boston within this fiscal year
- Tech marketing PA increasing visibility for spaces in NYC --&gt; Julie
- Thinking “Smarter not harder” as Spaces is down a PA this month.
- Toronto was great. 4 organizations gathered for an on-boarding/knowledge-share/team-building of Spaces. 3 year pilot of space finder in Toronto. First time our services really crossed the border, to Canada.

**Development (Marie-Louise)**

- Congratulations to Selena for the Artful.ly event and Leila too!
- Ben has joined the team and hard at work!
- Taken a swath of membership with high household net worth and tasking them to make a donation to HA.
- Officially invited for a 2 year grant at 600K from Mellon foundation
- Looks like Ford is going to invite a proposal – looking good
- Working with devel. committee of the board to strategize a smaller development model --&gt; Breakfast with great minds + deep pockets.
- Marie-Louise’s on-site hours will be dwindling in December

**Artful.ly (Selena)**
- Thanks to everyone who helped!
- A lot of press coming out of the event – there’s more trickling in. New organizations outside of FA’s member base are showing interest.
- Close to finishing the process for the hiring of the new tech PA position.
- Memberships, iOS app for scanning tickets, defining rel. b/w households and individuals, changing banking to chase – lots in the works!
- While site definitely had a spike in new user org after press, waiting to see if it translates to active customers. Nuyorican’s Poet Café has shown interest. Oz in Nashville with a lot of programming, symphony in Cleveland, and other sizable organizations too.

**Travel Update (Jason)**
- When creating travel events: fill out event name, location, staff person who is going. So anyone else looking at the calendar can figure out what’s going on.

**Communications Calendar and Protocol**

- Jason sent an email this morning with the directions for the communications calendar and protocol. Read and follow.
- Avoid cannibalizing our reach by posting at the same time.
- It’s a zimbra calendar that’s shared though editing is restricted to directors.
- Sproutsocial.com – everyone can get involved – install the bookmarklet to your bookmark bar. Save draft – DO NOT HIT SEND. Tim &amp; Jason will review the post.

### Operations

**Finance Report**

- Jason sent this around. FS projects pick up around this time and exceeds over the holidays. Similarly with Artfully there's growth over the year. The little data we have is solid.

**Staffing Update**

- We onboarded 5 people and offboarded 2 people. A lot going on so great to have 2 AA’s to split the duties. Tech PA to be hired soon as #6 and possibly a software contractor as #7. Theresa expressed interest in Tech PA but she does a lot of things for us that can’t be replaced within the timeline. So though not within the regular timeline, will get Theresa in the mix.
- In December, will start posting for the programs PA position.

**Office Capacity**

- We are running out of seats. This office will no longer fit our needs within the next year.
- Space utilization – renovate our office bunk-bed style? Can we accommodate 7-10 people by renovating this space? No opportunity to move elsewhere in the building. Retooling of what happens in the excel mines. Maybe fellows will have to move to the backyard. FA is growing and it’s a lot of people to handle! Moving will be a full-time job for like 3 months…

Our old health insurance plans canceled as of 12/31 – Jean Ann is looking into ACA compliant plans.

**Holiday Schedule**

- Monday is Veteran’s Day so the office is officially closed!
- More on people working from home soon. Necessary technology like phones, etc.
- Half-day on Wednesday before Thanksgiving and Thursday and Friday off.

**Financial Reminders (Jillian)**
- Joyce AA of operations – support for Jillian!
- Per diem – make sure to get Jillian requests the week before you’re going so that we can cut a check and get it out to you
- Receipts – when submitting, it should be electronic and try to be very clear if it’s a cc charge or a reimbursement
- Expense &amp; grant allocations – be mindful. If you’re spending something related to the grant, note that Tim has a NEW credit card so make sure you update it.
- Accounts Receivable – more money coming in related to software consulting, get Jillian anything related to Gemini
- If you have the option of renaming the receipt, rename with date of expense incurred. (i.e. 2013-11-6.Seamless)
- Ticket allowance – let Jillian know if you’re buying a ticket for yourself or other people on staff
- With 3rd ward closing, let Jillian know if you took a class there.
- PREGNANT – Jillian is expecting 3/13/14!!!!!!!

### Welcome

Marcus &amp; Julie, welcome!

### Ask the ED

**The Advantage**
- Grueling 2 days but emerged not hating each other 
- First day about challenging group dynamics, etc. Great experience and learning to work effectively as a team. Second day about strategy, core values, etc. – The Advantage playbook. 
- Haven’t fully completed the work on developing our ‘playbook’ but hoping to get through much of what remains this afternoon. Figured out what our core purpose for existing is -- ‘to maximize humanity’s creative potential.' Fractured Atlas empowers artists to succeed as entrepreneurs. We create products, services, and systems that help with the business aspects of working in the arts. (description on homepage). 
- Is this process something that other levels of the team will go through? 
 - TBD. We’ll wait until the directors are more comfortable with this to see if it would be beneficial to others. 
 - Team vs. working group – parallel to golf vs. basketball team. It’s not that the organization is broken and needs to be fixed – it’s that it’s changed and grown and the way it runs has started to be less effective. We need to adapt accordingly.

**Ask the ED**

- Task forces and leadership presence in them. Task forces …Daily standup for admin stuff, Weekly standup for tactical stuff
- What’s the dream structure? More collaboration between programs? Dream structure TBD. Leadership team is very much about institutional strategy. Components of that are finance or program specific. It’s possible that there will be more collab among other teams.
- We will in the next week or so be shifting the emphasis in our messaging on membership dues billing cycles. Headline number is the annual number right now but from here on out, we’re going to emphasize the monthly number and make it the default. Will see how people respond and potentially discontinue the annual fee. Stop mentioning the annual fee from here on out. Phasing it out because the idea of annual dues is an old, trade-association model. Monthly is more modern (i.e. Netflix, hulu) and online-centric. Also there may be financial benefits to doing it this way and fewer refunds to process and such.
- Website homepage has been updated with minor changes. Small copy changes are pretty easy to make. Member photo slideshow has been removed and replaced with substantive what we do info. Includes an explicit call to donate.

### Program Activities


**Arts Entrepreneur Award (Dianne)**

- It’s in Basecamp so check there for structure and timeline.
- Everyone submit nominations for people we would like to see.
- Task force is reviewing these. In January, will be picking the 3-5 who are the award recipients.
- It would be nice to have some of our members selected as recipients. They don’t need to be our members, can be anyone big or small.

**Insurance (Jean Ann)**

- Has been focusing on restructuring the language used when talking about the programs. Language changes on website and boilerplate.
- JA is in the process of creating a cheat sheet to circulate.
- Changing from talking about our services as a cheap option to the customer service we provide. Low cost is important but also important that they have a quality product.
- Finally, this is the last month of health insurance for members!

**Archipelago/Advisory Services/Research (Ian)**

- Check for 95,000 finally here from back in August!
- Database redesign and extending the interface that we had previously developed. Submitted our first cultural planning proposals.
- Will see what happens in Utica NY. Also have a bunch of other irons in the fire.

**Software Consulting (Shawn)**

- Have been racking up all the work from before the Gemini-FA merger.
- Our fellows have been doing a great job on Fractured U. and will have something to share in the next couple of weeks with us to see if we can perhaps re-launch Fractured U. in the next few months.

**Fiscal Sponsorship (Juliana)**
- FS team working on revising the annual report to make it a bit more user-friendly and make it easier for people. Open call was unpleasant for both staff and members filling it out.
- Trying to figure out what to do with swept funds.
- All-day crowdfunding meeting to talk about the Ford meeting in January.
- FS conference next year for fiscally sponsored projects? – bigger question of whether we’ll have a whole FA conference. If anyone has any ideas about the conference on a larger scale, feel free to join the FS team meeting. What would be the purpose of the meeting/conference? A lot of stuff to hash out.

**Spaces (Lisa)**

- Tech PA, Marcus and Julie, Spaces Marketing Fellow joins the team.
- Chap is working on a mobile-responsive version of the site.
- Rebranding.
- Know off the top of your head what city we have Spaces in.

**Development (Marie-Louise)**

- Trying to get a slice of our membership with a household of $250k or more. It ended up being around 4000 mailings to those households, ML thinks.
- Working on a final report to Hewlett and a report to Bay Area Spaces.
- Gathering very small groups 6-8 of people interested in FA and capacity to give for breakfast – should be an authentic FA experience matching up people’s interests with these topics and meet Adam. Then leverage the interest in these ideas to interest in supporting FA to help flourish these ideas. Maybe involve press down the line.

**Artful.ly (Selena)**

- A quiet heads down month on customer service and otherwise. 80% done stage – will push through these in the next couple months. Getting Dan familiar with the coding.
- Beta tester in Texas – festival ticketing through membership. Still making decisions about pricing.
- There was a noticeable user bump after the launch but hard to determine if they’re just poking around or if they’re sticking around. Will be able to determine in a couple months.

**Travel Update (Jason)**
- Jason said stuff then he said – he got engaged!!!!

### Operations

**Holiday Schedule**

- Closed half-day on the eves and closed full day on Christmas &amp; New Year’s. We are open the rest of those weeks. If you are planning on taking days off, tell your director ASAP.

**Holiday Bonuses**
- This is detailed in the employee handbook if you don’t know about it. It goes on the Dec. 15th paycheck at the level specified in the handbook. If you want to get your 401k changed for that, change that by tomorrow (Dec. 6th). Otherwise, your 401k deduction will be the default.

**Office Capacity**
- No updates on office space/size.

**Good Neighbor reminder**
- Please pick up after yourself – clean the kitchen if you make a mess. Don’t leave trash around.

**Annual self-assessment schedule**
- After your 6 month review, you get thrown into the annual self-assessment. Tim will send around emails. Schedule your appointment with your director(s) if time.

**Wrap-up**

- Weekly roundup email (Beta test). With things like updating your emergency contact in the wiki, things like that.
- There will be a new listing going up for a PA so if you know anyone…
- Most doctors offices don’t seem to know which health insurances they are going to take. We are looking at 2 options – continue with EmblemHealth’s HMO or go to a new carrier, Health Republic which has no track record. We are going to decide on Monday which company to go with so if you want to check wih your doctor to see which one they will accept and tell JA by Monday. Affects the people in NYC on the company plan and also the stipend amount. We are considering adding dental coverage to this [insert toothy smile :D] Thanks to JA for dealing with this whole new health insurance program!!
- Finance report didn’t make it out before this meeting but Tim will email.

		<field name="content"># Mac Tips &amp; Tricks

Feel free to contribute any cool tips and tricks you pick along the way while using a Mac.

## Screenshots

* **Save Screenshot to Desktop:** *Cmd+Shift+4* and then your mouse cursor will turn into crosshairs. Draw a rectangle around the area you want to screenshot and an image will be automatically created and placed on your desktop.

* **Save Screenshot to Clipboard:** *Cmd+Control+Shift+4* and then your mouse cursor will turn into crosshairs. Draw a rectangle around the area you want to screenshot and an image will be stored to your clipboard and ready for pasting.

## Working With Text

These tips are great for manipulating text on a Mac. It works on almost every application, like mail, web, Flowdock, etc.

* **Jump to End of Word:** *Option+Arrow* The arrow can either be left or right arrow depending on the direction you wish to jump.

* **Jump to End of Line:** *Cmd+Arrow* The arrow can either be left or right arrow depending on the direction you wish to jump.

* **Select Word:** *Option+Shift+Arrow* The arrow can either be left or right arrow depending on the direction you wish to select.

* **Select Line:** *Cmd+Shift+Arrow* The arrow can either be left or right arrow depending on the direction you wish to select.

* **Remove Text After Cursor:** *Ctrl+k* will delete all text *after* your cursor. Useful for trimming URLs and such.

* **Emoji:** *Ctrl+Cmd+Space* Opens up the emoji picker on any text field.

* **Define a Word:** *Hover over a word and 3-finger 'touch' the trackpad (don't click)* This will bring up a popup with the definition of the word along with options for loading the Wikipedia entry.

* **Dictate Text** *Double tap FN* This will bring up a microphone icon that will allow you to dictate text and punctuation. 

* **Accents and other diacritical marks** hold your finger down on a letter key, and a popup will appear with diacritical marks. Click on the character you want, or use a number key to select it. This works on iPhones, too.

## Multi-tasking

* **Toggle Between Open Apps:** *Cmd+Tab* Quick way to jump between open apps. You can also use *Cmd+Shift+Tab* to move in the other direction.

* **Open Mission Control:** *Ctrl+Up Arrow* This can also be configured as a mouse shortcut in *System Preferences*.

* **Switch Spaces:** *Ctrl+Right or Left Arrow* You can add or remove spaces from the top portion in *Mission Control*. Spaces are like blank desktops you can use to organize your open apps. This can also be customized with mouse shortcuts.

* **Quit App:** *Cmd+q*

* **Close Window:** *Ctrl+w* This will close a single for a given application (like when you have multiple browser windows or email messages open).

## Opening Files and Apps

* **Open a File:** *Cmd+Space* Then type *open* and the filename. *Spotlight* will search your computer for this filename.

* **Open an App:** *Cmd+Space* Then type the name of the app you want to open (doesn't need to be the whole name). 

* **Quicklook:** *Select a file and press Space* This will show you a full preview of a file without having to open up the supporting application. Works for almost all file types and works great in *Mail*.

* **Get details about a file** *Cmd+i on a file you've highlighted* this will bring up a pane that gives you detailed information about a file. useful for getting file sizes and other nerdy details. 

## Volume and Brightness

There are volume and brightness keys on Mac keyboards, but sometimes each block of brightness or volume is just too loud or too bright. There is a way to move up and down, though, that isn't a full block.

* **Micro Volume Adjustment:** *Option+Shift+Volume Up or Down*

* **Micro Brightness Adjustment:** *Option+Shift+Brightness Up or Down*

## Passwords

Macs come with one built-in password manager that works in Safari and any iOS devices you may have. Additionally, all other system passwords will be stored here along with wifi passwords. So if you ever need to recall a password or give someone the wifi password, open the *Keychain* app.

## Web Browsing

This works in all browsers.

* **Toggle the address bar:** *Cmd+l* This will place your cursor on the address bar and select the existing URL to make it easy for you to type in a new address.

* **Switch Tabs:** *Cmd+Shift+[ or ]* This will navigate to the next tab to the left or right of your current tab, respectively. This actually works for all tabbed applications as well.

* **Open New Tav:** *Cmd+t*

* **Refresh Page:** *Cmd+r*</field>

Chair: Jillian Wright

Full Staff Meeting

Thursday, January 2nd, 12:00-1:00PM

### January Action Items
- Make sure to read The Advantage for the Jan. 15th meeting
- Zimbra password needs to be changed soon, if it doesn’t meet the requirements!
- Remote folks need to make plans to be here on March 5th if they want to participate in the Will Carlin session.
- FYI- Skype no longer works on Bluejeans so take appropriate actions.
- Communications calendar – please remember to follow the new communications procedure. S.W.A.P.: Schedule your post/Write your post/Announce when post is ready for review/Publish
- Email Theresa your Secret Santa Birthday person!

### December Action Items
- Update/add your emergency contact info to the Wiki. DONE.
- For receipts, please specify whether reimbursement or company credit card. GOOD ENOUGH.
- For Sproutsocial.com – initial on draft or email Jason. SOME ARE DOING THIS.
- Feel free to join the FS team meeting if you have ideas about a larger FA meeting/conference. MEETING HAPPENED.
- Know off the top of your head what city we have Spaces in. GETTING THERE.
- The Advantage for your holiday reading - now REQUIRED reading for the meeting on Jan. 15th
- Be a good neighbor and clean up after yourself. PLEASE CONTINUE TO KEEP THIS IN MIND.

### Ask the ED

**Update on Fractured U.:** Demo for a handful of staff members went well. Came out of that with items to address. Still trying to figure out what the actual format of the videos is going to be. Powerpoint templates with voiceover is NOT going to work. Working with Jason to explore other design possibilities – next to play around with is illustration – a lot more labor intensive to produce a course but trying to see how to make it manageable.

### Program Activities

**Archipelago/Advisory Services/Research (Ian)**
- Most staff have been exposed to a theory of change – these are getting rapidly refined. This is leading to one giant Theory of Change. *More time to work on advisory services than in previous years. More clarity for advisory services.
- When will we see the money from Harvard – they don’t have a record of paying us in a timely session.

**Artful.ly (Selena)**

- Not a huge month in artful.ly news – heads down kind of month with everything in 80% stage.
- Switching to Chase for ACH in the next week or two – customers will be able to settle/get their money faster and with more clarity about what they’re getting their money for.
- Regarding webinar system – getting on the same page across programs for a similar webinar platform. FuzeMeeting is much better than GoToMeeting according to Alison!

**Development (Marie-Louise)**

- Busy season for Development – Mellon proposal, Serdna Foundation, Hewlett due this month, Seattle RFP, etc. – doghunting season for Spaces!
- Pending with the meeting with the Ford foundation for the crowdfunding initiative.
- 12 actual gifts through the gift appeal+3 through the e-appeal  2900 total annual for response to the appeals: not a huge number but heartening. When people sign up they’re presented with an option to donate and many are signing up. Next step is to develop a framework to understand to how people donate to FA. Mailing of 300 in-house and about 4000 (but they didn’t get these until last week) for the appeals.
- Working with Ian on proposals for advisory services.

**Fiscal Sponsorship (Juliana)**

- Recovering from December. Christmas cards this year to about 2500 and no complaints about that so far. Extra thanks to Leila and Jason for help on that!
- Webinars starting back up in January.
- Also got through 1099s so everyone should have updated their legal entities, if necessary.
- $2 million in donations for FS projects in December. On the last day of the year, it was around $200,000. A very significant December! About $1.8 mil last year and about $2.1 mil this year in December – so not that much larger but still significant. Don’t know if this is proportional to membership growth though. Adam says it is outpacing.

**Insurance (Jean Ann)**

- Health insurance program is now done!
- Scott is getting his broker’s license – he will be out of the office for 3 weeks starting Monday. Be extra nice to insurance PAs (i.e., Max) while they pick up the extra slack.
- MDP sent us a ton of snacks from Harry &amp; David!
- Shifting to – we’re NOT the best health insurance resource anymore – they should go to their state sites.

**Spaces (Lisa)**

- Do or Die for January is simple: Boston and Toronto need to get onboard!
- One-pager or a posting in the office or a Spaces map so that the staff is up to date would be great.

**Software Consulting (Shawn)**

- Wrapping up major project work for consulting and transitioning to internal projects. Remaining work from merger are being completed now. With so much to do on the FA side, not actively working on other projects.
- Current fellows will be with us through mid-February.

**Arts Entrepreneur Award (Jason)**

- Thanks to everyone who shared or nominated! Over 80 nominations with 52 unique organizations nominated. All will be reviewed by the task force. They’ll meet Monday to settle on 5 winners and will announce winners mid-month.
- Criteria: exemplify creating a new solution to an old problem or doing something exceptionally well that has been allowing their business to expand.
- We’re not making public everyone that has been nominated. We’ll be reaching out to the finalists for headshots and such though.

**Will Carlin Presentation 3/5/14 (Selena)**

- Will Carlin is a pro speech and presentation coach. Selena participated in a session in grad school. He’ll do a session with us on presentation/speaking/slide-presentation on March 5th. This is in response to staff not being comfortable with powerpoint/presentations – something helpful for us to do as a group.
- Will has feelings about what makes successful presentations. Different strategies for doing a presentation in person and for doing it in webinar – so totally different formats for the two types. So if you want to participate, there’s NO remote option – you must be in New York on March 5th. It’ll be in the morning from 10am to around 1pm.
- Selena says it’s empowering! In general, when scheduling things involving people coming in to NYC, better in the afternoon.

### Operations

**Finance Report:** look at report
- Your Zimbra password needs to be changed soon if it’s a crummy, insecure one! 1 lower case, 1 upper case, 1 number, 1 alphanumeric character – 8 characters total. Make sure to update NetDrive passwords too. This information should have been cascaded.
- Everyone who has FA health insurance, you’re now on Health Republic.
- Skype no longer works with Bluejeans.
- FA snow policy: if the NYC public schools are closed, FA office is officially closed; however, specialists on up will work and AAs &amp; Pas should still work if there’s internet. If the schools closed, we’re closed but if they start late or something like that, we still open. Check NYC.gov for info. Make sure when working on personal computers that you delete all sensitive data (e.g., SSN) off properly. Do *67 so the number is blocked if you must call on a snow day. NetDrive remote access – Jason will update the wiki with instructions.
- Social Media:Communications calendar – please remember to follow the new communications procedure. S.W.A.P.: Schedule your post/Write your post/Announce when post is ready for review/Publish
- Only drawing for people physically in the office this year. For people working remotely, we are going to do it separately. Email Theresa who you have after you draw. The budget is $50 for each person. Can combine with another person for parties. Is there a calendar of everyone’s birthdays so that we know? Theresa will send a list.

- Fractured U. ball is in Adam’s court and is on the backburner right now. Adam may not have dedicated time/attention for it until August. Adam is likely taking another August retreat.
- The audit: we should be getting the draft any day now. We are just waiting…

### Program Activities


**Software Consulting (Shawn)**
- New/returning member, Christine!
- Trying to move away from surfacing legacy clients, moving toward clients who support FA (i.e. Arts in Sacred Spaces).

**Spaces (Lisa)**

- Send out renter survey and got around 100 responses. Julie the marketing fellow did great execution of surveys. What info is most valuable: rate, photos, reviews from others, etc. What space related topics are you interested in getting email on: liability insurance! If you want to see the analyzed data, email Lisa.
- Hewlett is 99% sure they will fund Bay Area Spaces. $65000 over the next some years. Gaining about 50 venues that have synced calendars that aren’t paying, while losing just a few paying customers to what will now be free accounts.

**Insurance (Jean Ann)**

- Finally EmblemHealth issue cleared up! They have acknowledged that our enrollment has ended as of January 1.
- Working with Bob and insurance companies to do better.
- Good job on the ongoing stair challenge!

**Fiscal Sponsorship (Dianne)**

- Changed the annual report that fiscally sponsored projs have to submit from our fiscal year to the calendar year. In the mean time, they have to submit a report to make up for the 4-month gap. Calling it a “mini-report.”
- Updating the manual to incorporate the above change and some others.
- Pivotal tracker for only helpdesk stories or infrastructure, moving F.S. and insurance ones out.
- F.S. donations have slowed down so Dianne is working on increasing donations. Our projected rate of growth is not where it should be. Who are the big projects that are leaving and are there projects of similar size that we can attract?

**Development (Marie-Louise)**

- As Lisa mentioned, Hewlett! Spaces funding in Austin, Denver, one more.
- Thanks to everyone who helped Ben with DCA – it’s almost ready to submit.
- Two very large reports due this month. Leave Ben alone to make headway his last couple days.
- Ford meeting was canceled. Waiting to hear back on Ford meeting reschedule. Another meeting also canceled due to snow.

- Membership for sale: being tested by Fusebox in Austin. Creating a new kind of object that could be sold in Artful.ly. Congratulations to Gary! Fusebox and Jason’s org is going to test it. Looking for a few more membership-based organizations to test – let Selena know. Fine to share the information that the membership functionality is coming. Fee is 5% of the membership fee. Producer can choose whether to make the patron pay the fee or absorb the fee.
- Going to try out gotowebinar.com – will let others know how it goes.

**Archipelago/Advisory Services/Research (Ian)**

- Many were involved in the theories of change for various programs at FA so thanks to everyone who participated in some way. That part of the process is almost complete. Drafts sitting with various program directors. Will meet with Adam to discuss them in a couple weeks. Will develop a grand theory of change for FA. Rationalize the program portfolio. Will discuss at the next off-site.
- A lot of the work Ian is doing is going to play a big part in the work with the Santa Cruz Museum/Nina Simon.
- Archipelago: sock launch in Detroit is scheduled for March 17th. That’ll be the first time that anyone can access Archie. Anyone meaning anyone without pre-approval. Other milestone for Archie: first archie implementation that doesn’t involve Sustain Arts in Utica, NY.

**Fractured Atlas Party (Dianne)**

- Last time we had a full-on party in NYC was V-Day last year. 3rd Ward is gone so we can’t have it there again.
- Will start a mini-task force for the party so if you want to join, let Dianne know.
- Want to have a party before the summer.

**Museum Camp: Social Impact Assessment (Ian)**

- July 30th- Aug 2nd in Santa Cruz. FA co-sponsoring an event with Santa Cruz Museum. They are having something like a 3-day summer camp.
- There is a competitive app process but Nina Simon has agreed to reserve 7 spots for FA staff.
- 2 ppl (Dianne &amp; Lisa) are confirmed already beside Ian. Can use PD fund to pay for the trip.
- Deadline is Feb. 28th if you do want to sign up. Will need to go through the regular process and submit the app but let Ian know.

### Operations


**Finance Report (Tim)**

- Tim interviewing for new PA now. Gary &amp; Shawn are still looking for new staff member. Ben is leaving. After the initial round of PAs, will figure out what to do about development team.
- President’s Day: we are closed.
- A lot of interviewees coming in so be mindful of what we say about members and such.
- Tim will circulate version of the Play Book next week.
- No progress on making more space here for more people. What about swing desks?

**Social Media Reports (Jason)**

*Facebook:* our organic reach is dropping significantly. Used to be 500-1000 impressions and now only 200-400 impressions. Facebook has announced they are moving toward more of a paid model rather than organic reach. How important is Facebook as a platform for us?
Member survey went out on Wednesday. Redesigned from the ground up. Went out to 24000 and responses from 900.

*Arts Entrepreneurship Awards:* Winners announced. Went through a grading process similar to what fiscally sponsored projs go through. Gotten a bit of press from it, both us and the winners. Hopefully we’ll get a different designer each year to make the trophy so that we’ll have a collection.

**Financial Task Reallocation: Jillian's leave (Jillian)**

- Look out for Jillian’s email later on this month. In general, know that Tim is going to be doing all of the development related stuff. Joyce is picking up most of the day-to-day things. A consultant, Alexis, will be coming in one day every other week or so. She won’t be the one to ask questions to; ask Tim.
- Receipts, invoices/bills, and stuff like that will eventually go to Joyce.
- Joyce has sent you an email with a tally of your PD/ticket allowance, if you have spent some of it. Don’t wait until the end to try to spend all of you money!

### Ask the ED


Adam wants to answer questions about the memo he sent last week:

- 2 major mission categories for mission impact: language of mission statement lends itself to thinking about outcomes of impacts. Thinking about why we want to remove barriers to artistic expression and what that would look like – leveling the playing field and providing an opportunity for more voices to get out there. Are we in fact eliminating barriers? The greatest indicator of that would be a proliferation of voices. diversity with a lowercase ‘d’ – not strictly talking about racial, ethnic diversity – talking about it in a broader sense. Haven’t gotten to a point where we know what the specific metrics will be. For FA’s mission as a whole, what should we be measuring that success of that mission by?
- Premium level of service: we don’t know yet what the premium level will bring forth. Do premium members get premium customer service? It’s possible that ultra-premium members will have a dedicated staff member but we only have half-baked ideas for the time being.
- My Stuff drop down menu – possible to change it to be on the front page so that members don’t have to go looking for important links? We will develop a centralized member dashboard that will take care of this problem. Not within the next couple months but not too far in the future either.
- The timeline for this thematic goal is the end of May. But we don’t expect to accomplish everything outlined in the memo by then.
- Single login is finally happening! It’s all set to be clearly branded under Fractured Atlas now.

### Program Activities


**Software Consulting (Shawn)**

- April 22nd launch of New World Symphony’s Musaic website.
- Spaces implementation for Arts in Sacred Spaces.
- Trying to control the amount of work that comes in b/c they’re at capacity for the workload.

**Spaces (Lisa)**
- Mobile-friendly renter site now up! It’s our first mobile-responsive FA site.

**Insurance (Jean Ann)**
- Insurance program has been sliding in income the past few months but now we are above and beyond where we wanted to be at this point. A third more business than we did at this time this year.
- Two weeks from now, the MDP brokers should be here to check out FA. Say hello!

**Fiscal Sponsorship (Dianne)**

- Trying to finish reviewing the mini reports this month.
- Hired one new PA to start on the 27th and hope to make a decision on the second tomorrow.
- Moving forward with using the Ford money.
- Going to redo a webinar based on Will Carlin’s tips.
- Need to update program manual.
- Jobs Act: not within our scope right now. Equity and philanthropy side by side=morass. Morass: 1) an area of muddy or boggy ground. 2) a complicated or confused situation.

**Development (Marie-Louise)**

- Juliana has joined the development team!
- NEA reports, Con Edison, Matisse Fondation due this month. Looking to partner with Con Edison.
- Meeting with Ford this month.
- Very interested in what happens with the membership party – we want to be able to bring donors to that to sponsor Spaces (e.g., SpaceFinder NYC brought to you by Con Edison).

**Artful.ly (Selena)**

- Tara is leaving us to move on to big things!
- Eric is dipping his toes into Artful.ly coding starting this week.
- Printable tickets, iOS scanner, etc. should be rolling out to general users soon.
- We have started talking to a large organization (Jacob Burns Film Center: nonprofit indie cinema in Westchester) – it’s a cool opportunity!

**Archipelago/Advisory Services/Research (Ian)**

- Two big things to talk about: Archie milestone on the 17th – soft launch of Sustain Arts SE Michigan portal – the first time that regular people will have an opportunity to use and work with Archipelago. All leading to a public launch. Alison will send the link around for the portal.
- Museum of Art History in Santa Cruz – working with them over the course of the next 7 months to essentially replicate FA as a learning organization for them. This has officially kicked off and Ian heads off to SC next week and it’ll conclude in October.
- Discussed how we won’t discuss EmcArts learning organization model now.

### Operations

**Finance Report &amp; Staffing (Tim)**
- Percentage outpacing the projected. Look at report.
- Juliana: development specialist. Theresa: fiscal sponsorship specialist. Nathan: concentrating on fiscal sponsorship.
- Two generalist PA’s to be hired soon. Another full-time PA to work in Spaces and Artful.ly Still working on a software developer.
- This month also posting for next round of software developer fellows.
- Search for Director of Development. Finding a director of development is challenging as anticipated. Would like to avoid hiring a headhunter if possible.
- So potentially 8 people coming on board in the near future. We have run out of desks so we are shuffling around. External relations will be in the Excel mines. Christine is moving into the finance room. Alexis will be here a couple hours every other week at Jillian’s desk. An architect who specializes in space utilization will be coming by to look at our office. Not bunk desks but solutions to reconfigure the office. Looking for extra space in the building because moving would be a pain.

**Taskforce Update (Tim)**

- Tweaks to taskforce structure: further hone what taskforces do. Finite project (not as open as marketing and diversity): accomplish it and disband. Diversity task force has become diversity training task force. Marketing task force is finishing up the FA presentation and then will move on.
- Hopefully this means more people can be involved with shorter terms of duty. More leadership opportunities for people through taskforces.

Chair: Nathan Zebedeo

Thursday, May 1, 2014 12:00-1:00PM

### May Action Items

- Use discretion when replying all to show invites - invitations to all staff are fine but replies to all staff are discouraged.
- Be a good neighbor - clean the french press, replace the toilet paper since the dispenser is not locked, etc.
- Be nice to the insurance team in their busiest month.
- Send Jean Ann your fitness challenge tally &amp; suggestions for bimonthly challenges.
- Check out the media page on the website to see links to the publicity for the software developer fellowship, featuring Christine!

### Ask the ED

- The board meeting this month – one hour pre-meeting and an hour of the actual meeting. Pre-hour was all about the credit union question. The meeting itself was fairly straightforward without surprises. Board members exploring some new ideas about governance – why model our governance after traditional nonprofits?
- Director of Development search – have talked to about six people, haven’t anything to report yet.
- Fractured U. – until 2 days ago, nothing was going on. But on Tuesday, Adam had an interesting conversation with a director of education at Baruch College because he’s interested in a Fractured Atlas certificate program. Very early stages of exploration but worth looking at.
- Strategic priorities memo – is it redundant or confusing next to the playbook? It seems like we want the memo still.

### Program Activities

**Development (Marie-Louise)**

- Finally submitted official proposal to Ford for crowdfunding project. Will be followed by a proposal to Duke and more.
- About ready to send in our usual request to the Matisse Foundation after a good meeting with them.
- Lisa is in Denver this week to talk to foundations. Austin is still out there, Seattle doesn’t look like it’ll happen.
- Juliana is working to enhance to database to be better for development.

**Advisory Services/Research (Ian)**

- Archipelago is no longer on this list, if you’ll notice. No longer a FA program officially but still in the mix of things we do here. Now an advisory services relationship with Harvard. Christine is going to be taking on a role, doing tech support for that product when it launches publicly.
- Other major project going on is with Santa Cruz MAH. Ian is about to embark in training on decision-making.
- Ian is starting to do some more internal modeling and research to support decisions the organization is making. We may be hearing more about this in the future.
- No plans to replace Alison’s role in the near future since the program she was supporting is no longer a program. Alison is continuing to work for us as a consultant so still involved with FA.

**Insurance (Jean Ann)**

- May is the busiest month of the entire year in insurance! Be kind to be your insurance providers.
- Have been working with the Burning Man folks the past month. They are thinking of requiring insurance for art projects that go to the festival – that would mean a lot of business for us and lots of weird things to insure. Burning Man reached out to us after hearing great things through projects.

**Software Consulting (Shawn)**

- Started work on a new round of updates to the national fiscal sponsor website. New World Symphony has pushed back the launch date for the Musaic so will be pushing through the summer.
- New developer that was supposed to start today is no longer. Mutually decided to go separate ways. Might be working with Xentio more rather than hiring a new developer.

### Operations

- Good Neighbor Reminder: Clean the French press, general dishwashing, bathroom upkeep (Ladies – anyone can change the toilet paper, it requires no key to open the toilet paper holder)
- Staff Email for Show Invites: Should we have a separate listserv for show invites? No for now - just be mindful when you respond about not responding to all staff. Invitations to all staff are fine but replies to all staff are discouraged.

**Fitness Challenge Update (Jean Ann)**

- Jean Ann hasn’t had a chance to tally everything. Count your own and send tally to Jean Ann. The prize = instgram magnets.
- Would like to continue the tradition of having a fitness challenge every other month so send suggestions to Jean Ann.

**Finance Report &amp; Staffing (Tim)**

- Visa requests passed the finish line earlier this year. More updates – look at finance report. Have been looking at the drop in growth rate to see what the cause may be.
- Summer Fridays – work 4 hours a day (9am-1pm or 10am-2pm). If you work the full 8-hour day, accrue a half day of vacation – must email Tim with the day or it doesn’t count. You can gain 7 full days of vacation over the summer this way.
- Office space: still waiting to see if the 11th floor is an option. Shawn, Chap and Adam are working on an initiative to decouple us from our phones, internet-based phone so you can move desks. Working to replicate the desktop you have for access on any computer. Also looking at options for different configurations in the bullpen.
- We potentially have 3 software fellows starting in June that will sit in the backyard, if they are all in NYC. 57 applications for the software developer fellowships. Check out the media page on the website to see links to the publicity for the fellowship.
- We will be posting what formerly was the admin assistant job as a receptionist job to test how that changes the applications. This should go live today or tomorrow.
- Jillian is beginning her gradual return – yesterday was her first day back. Two days next week, the following week three days (with one day actually in office). Still largely off the radar but starting to come back.
- Self Assessments: Tim will take a look to make sure everyone is in the cycle. Everyone should fill these out at least once a year.

### June Action Items

- FA card holders: Specify whether FA card charge is on old or new card in this month of transitioning to the commercial card account.
- FS team: Make clear to projects that they cannot sell tax-deductible items on Artful.ly (Selena, if this is mistranscribed info, please correct)
- All on-site: Please be a good neighbor - we've made some progress on toilet paper replacement but please clean the french press. Also, do not leave your cup/dish in the sink. One item x 15 people = full dirty sink

### May Action Items

- Be a good neighbor - clean the french press, replace the toilet paper since the dispenser is not locked, etc. BABY STEPS

- Check out the media page on the website to see links to the publicity for the software developer fellowship, featuring Christine! DONE

### Ask the ED

- Bob Middleton leaving the board: Bob decided to step down from the board about a month ago. He felt like his time on the board has run its course. He’s also the broker who works with the insurance program. His resignation has nothing to do with the insurance program. The board has changed a ton since Bob has joined.
- National Arts Strategies possible merger? Is this six feet under? The grave has been dug and the coffin has been lowered. We decided to abandon the situation.
- Fractured U. + Baruch certificate program? There’s been no progress on this/nothing to report. A must have for us is to have it available online and not only accessible to people who attend Baruch. That was more complicated than they expected it to be. We need to kill this zombie or revive it.
- Thematic goal memo to come. Officially concluded the work on establishing the thematic goal. No radical new ideas since the last memo.
- Phone system – Chap did an amazing job putting together a working prototype of a soft phone, a software-based phone system (e.g. Skype), that is integrated into the helpdesk. The basic framework is in place. Max is going to be our guinea pig within the next couple weeks. It’ll make it easier for people to work remotely when a large part of their job is working at the phone.
- Summer party - ton of work happening at Adam’s new house because he moved so maybe someone else could host this year? Jason wants to host a barbeque in his Long Island City home!

### Program Activities


**Development (Marie-Louise)**

- MLS is still here and will be joining the staff!
- Institutional and government deadlines coming up.
- Working on getting out a spring appeal, email &amp; snail mail (ppl who’ve given in the past) – first time doing spring appeals.
- Implementing things MLS has been talking about in the past 2 years like sustainable, renewable support. Unusual for a nonprofit organization of this size to rely so heavily on earned revenue
- Lots of good database tweaks

**Advisory Services/Research (Ian)**

- This month and the past month are in full swing with the Santa Cruz MAH museum camp.
- Exploration of decision analysis and such that the database DOG force has been working on. DOG force is pretty much coming to the end of the exploration phase and coming to the phase where they write recommendations. For the past year, a group of about 6 of us have been part of a task force investigating the possibility of using analytical techniques coming out of the business world to integrate data more seamlessly into decision-making.
- Starting to do more internal strategy and analysis work in relation to our programs currently. Like related to fiscal sponsorship, later on for insurance – Ian anticipates he’ll be doing more of this stuff in the months to come.

**Fiscal Sponsorship (Dianne)**
- Working on NYSCA apps this month. NYSCA changed their online apps so a lot of work for the F.S. team.
- Fiscal Sponsorship chats of Wed afternoons since no webinars in the summer
- June 17th &amp; 18th National Network of Fiscal Sponsors (NNFS) will be in office.
- July: open call for proposals for artists for the entrepreneur awards.

**Artful.ly (Selena)**

- Alessandra, welcome!
- FuseBox in Austin that used new Artful.ly features, membership iOS app – went well, they made more money than in the past year.
- Getting close to finishing a basic version of passes. Looking for a couple orgs to test those for us – like for a festival (one price for a set of tickets together). Not looking for a whole season to beta test, but just a short-term thing for now.
- Excited about the shift in the development team – means they get to work with Christine and Eric more.
- FS projects cannot sell on Artful.ly tax-deductible items

**Spaces (Lisa)**

1. Spotlight on Space campaign in the bay-area. 65K award from Hewlett to promote accessible space close to transportation.
2. Renter email communication that marketing fellow Julie created. Eric has been working on a system that centralizes our user profiles to set up communications for all 12 websites.
3. Developing new method for rental transactions. 350K in NYC this past year in terms of rental payments. New system is called Stripe. Necessary for us to do this in order to do business in Canada. Financial accounting will be less complicated with this new system.

**Insurance (Jean Ann)**

- Good news: Adam issued a challenge to insurance to hit a conversion rate of 45% in May after having done that in April (the amount of people who actually buy insurance after looking). The insurance team exceeded the challenge so Adam will take them out to dinner!
- Bad news: Volunteer accident policy is no longer going to be a flat fee. Will be a few different price points depending on how many volunteers you have. Won’t affect most of the people that get this coverage through us, since most of them have under 25 volunteers. Renewals will be unaffected – they will still pay the same $200, even if they have more than 25 volunteers.

**Software Consulting (Shawn)**

- Been working on the NNFS website. Really just an informational website up to this point but making it a more versatile site.
- Finished the discovery process for Arts in Sacred Spaces. Going to be starting real work on this. Building their own custom website on top of the API
- NWS was planning to launch last month but decided to launch at th start of their academic year.
- Software development fellowship starting up again: Mehan, Tracy, and Brigitte. Tracy is here today visiting! Mehan will work in this office.

### Operations


**Commercial Credit Card (Jillian)**

- We’ve opened up a new credit card account with online access for account holders to categorize their expenses and upload their receipts! We will give everyone the month of June as a transitional month.
- Please specify if a charge is on your old or new card when you send in receipts in this transition month.

**Fitness Challenge Update (Jean Ann)**

- Still haven’t tallied the instagram challenge but will do that sometime.
- One fitness challenge suggestion from Lisa is to do a 5K this summer and a 5K training program as a group. The one Lisa suggested in July is already sold out. Looking into inexpensive 5Ks in August – one over the Brooklyn Bridge on a Sunday at 7am and another on Riverside Park on a Wednesday at 6pm.
- Alternate fitness months with vice months – suggestion from Tim. If anyone wants in on buying group lotto tickets for the next month… or group dilling?

**Finance Report &amp; Staffing (Tim)**

- Entered the final quarter of the year as of the first of this year. Nearing the end of the fiscal year on August 31st.
- Budget process for next year—program directors are starting to make their budgets now.
- Passed the 6 mil mark for F.S. in the aggregate funds we are holding!
- Shawn mentioned the three new fellows coming in, Mentioned Alessandra, Mentioned MLS will be DoD
- JA and Dianne are really close on locking in the new receptionist. Hopefully will get the person in, in 2-3 weeks, completing the most recent surge on hiring.
- Uncoupling from phones and computers will allow us to be more flexible as we are running out of desks. But as of now, still have enough room. Still waiting to hear back about the 11th floor. Slightly different configuration for desks in the coming months.

Virtual tours give potential visitors  a comprehensive view of your space - from the entrance to the workspaces to the dressing and restrooms. They're a great way to highlight your venue's unique features and a valuable resource for visitors -- whether they’re interested in rehearsing in your studios or attending a performance. For disabled artists and audiences, a virtual tour helps assess whether or not your space will meet their needs.

**An in-depth look at the interior of your space enables patrons to view:**
- The layout of your space, for audiences and artists
- Unique features and details not mentioned on your website or on your listing
... and more!

**And helps disabled patrons answer questions such as:**
- Is the entrance to the venue wheelchair accessible?
- Will I be able to access this space and work in it comfortably?
- Are hallways and doorways wide enough for wheelchair users to navigate easily? 
- Is there adequate and clear signage throughout the venue?
- Are accessible restrooms located on the same floor as your facilities? 
... and more!

A virtual tour can either be a video of a space taken by you or a media artist, or a 360 degree view using Google Places. Then, you can link to the tour on your SpaceFinder listing by pasting the URL in the **Virtual Tour** field of the **Accessibility** section.

### Google Places 360 Degree Tour
This kind of virtual tour can be photographed by a Google certified photographer. To find a list of recommended photographers, check out [Google's list.](https://www.google.com/maps/streetview/trusted/)

**If you're located in the New York region, we recommend: [PlacesMobile, Inc.](http://www.placesmobile.com/)**

While using a virtual tour to document your space can be slightly more costly than a self-produced video, it provides the most thorough coverage of all it’s nooks and crannies--with minimal work on your behalf! After you've chosen a photographer, they'll spend less than an hour taking impressions of the interior of your space. Then, they'll take the impressions and put them together to create the 360-degree view and post it on Google Streetview. From there, you can grab the embed link from Google and include in your listing or link to it from your website!

		<field name="title">Adding People to MailChimp Lists or Groups</field>
		<field name="content">Through Artful.ly's integration with MailChimp, you can add fans to your people database either through Artful.ly or through MailChimp. 

##Adding People To Your Mailing List via MailChimp

- When a fan signs up via your [MailChimp sign up form,](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/create-signup-forms-and-response-emails) she is added to your mailing list. Then, MailChimp sends the person's contact information to Artful.ly, where we create a new record for them.
- When a fan signs up via a [MailChimp widget or link that you installed on your website,](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/host-your-own-signup-forms) she's added to your mailing list. Then, MailChimp sends the contact information to Artful.ly, and a new people record is created.
- You can also [import a list of people directly to a MailChimp list.](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/growth/import-subscribers-to-a-list)

##Adding People To Your Mailing List via Artful.ly

There are a few different ways that you can add a people from your Artful.ly account to your MailChimp lists or groups, either individually or in batches.

This is good for: 
 - Keeping members subscribed to a members-only group on MailChimp
 - Subscribing folks to interest-specific groups.
 - Sending follow-up messages to groups of people who have attended specific events or series of events.

##Add Individuals When They Opt-in to Your List With an Order

This happens when a fan purchases something or make a donation through your Artful.ly storefront and signs up during checkout. If she does not already have an Artful.ly record, one is created for her. Then, Artful.ly tells MailChimp to add her to your mailing list.

##Manually Add Individuals to Your Mailing List

To add an individual to one of your mailing lists or groups, go to their people record.

1. If they wish to be removed from a mailing list or group, uncheck the box next to the appropriate list. Then click **Save.**
2. To add them, check the box next to the appropriate mailing list or group. Then click **Save.**

  ![Add individual to specific mailing list](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=636 &quot;Add individual to specific mailing list&quot;)  

3. Select the appropriate scenario to confirm. If the individual has given you permission to add them to the list, then you do not need to send him or her an invitation to join. If he or she has not yet given permission, select the option to have Artful.ly send an invitation to join the list. Then click **Save**.  

[(More about permissions and compliance with anti-spam laws.)](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/compliance-tips/guidelines-for-list-compliance?&amp;_ga=1.215225951.913571212.1401485725) 

 ![Confirm adding an individual to a mailing list or group](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=637 &quot;Confirm adding an individual to a mailing list or group&quot;)
 
##Send Invitation from Order via Box Office or Sales Console

It's also possible to send an invitation to join your mailing list when you're processing an order on behalf of a fan through either the Box Office or through the Sales Console. When you're entering the person's contact and payment information, you'll see this as the last step before checking out. 

 ![Send invite to mailing list at checkout](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=643 &quot;Send invite to mailing list at checkout&quot;)

##Add a Batch of People

**From Advanced Search**

1. From the top navigation bar, go to **People** then **Advanced Search**.
2. Use search conditions to identify a batch of people.
3. Click on the **Work With...** button.
4. Select **Subscribe to MailChimp list** or **Subscribe to MailChimp list group** and then select the appropriate list or group.

 ![Advanced Search Dropdwon Menu](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=780 &quot;Advanced Search Dropdwon Menu&quot;)

**From a List Segment**

1. From the top navigation bar, go to **People** then **List Segments**.
2. Select a list segment.
3. Click on the **Work With...** button.
4. Select **Subscribe to MailChimp list** or **Subscribe to MailChimp list group** and then select the appropriate list or group.
 
 ![Add people from a list segment](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=847 &quot;Add people from a list segment&quot;)
 
* If you are adding people to a list, this will subscribe users that are not already subscribed to the list. They will receive a confirmation email and will only be successfully subscribed once they've accepted the invitation.
* If you are adding people to a group, this will only add users to a group if they are subscribed to the list already.

Note: This is a one-time push to add people to your MailChimp account, it will not happen automatically for new additions to your database. After this, when you add new people to an Artful.ly segment, you'll need to go through these steps again to add them to the MailChimp list or group.

		<field name="title">How do I update my MailChimp lists and groups in Artful.ly?</field>
		<field name="content">On September 22, 2015, we released version 2.0 of our Mailchimp integration. In order to take advantage of the updated integration features and see these changes on your account, you may need to re-sync the Artful.ly connection with MailChimp. 

This also applies to you if you ever add, delete, rename, or reorganize the lists and groups in your MailChimp account. To see these changes reflected in Artful.ly, you'll most likely need to resync the connection between the two apps. (But you should NOT have to change or update your API key.)

When you are logged in as an Organization administrator, here's how to re-sync:

1. Go to your **Account Administration** page, then view the **Kits** section.
2. Under MailChimp, click **Configure**.
3. Select **Manage my connected lists**.  

 ![Manage connected lists button](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=638 &quot;Manage connected lists button&quot;)

4. Do not change any of the settings on this page, just click on the **Save** button at the bottom. This will kick off the sync.

 ![Save button to resync connection](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=639 &quot;Save button to resync connection&quot;)

**Note:** It may take some time for the sync to complete, especially if you've got a lot of subscribers. If you don't see changes right away, check back after an hour.

		<field name="content">### Travel Expenses

When staff members are out of the office due to necessary business travel, Fractured Atlas will pay for the following:

- all core travel expenses including hotel, airfare, train, bus
- a rental car with gas and tolls if deemed necessary with prior approval by a supervisor
- roundtrip transportation between the airport and hotel in the destination city is covered for up to $80 total or $40 each way.

If you choose to travel between the airport and hotel via methods that exceed the allowance in the destination city, you will have to pay for the difference out of pocket and you will not be reimbursed. Employees traveling together may choose to combine this allowance if they so wish.


### Per Diem

Fractured Atlas will provide a daily Per Diem rate as dictated by the Federal General Services Administration which sets specific rates pegged to each region of the country annually. The Per Diem is intended to cover:
- Meals
- Incidental expenses (IE are defined as tips given to porters, baggage carriers, bellhops, hotel maids and transportation between places of lodging/business and places where meals are taken, it suitable meals cannot be obtained on site). 
- Travel to and from your home and your local airport should come out of your per diem.

The M&amp;IE allowance will be disbursed prior to the trip and may be used at the staff member's discretion; however, receipts and documentation are requested whenever possible and are required if an expense exceeds $75. If no M&amp;I documentation can be provided within 30 days following the travel dates, the unused portion of the disbursement must be returned to the Managing Director in order to comply with the law.

The current M&amp;I rates for every region of the country can be found here: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104877
**First and last days of travel are calculated at 75% of the posted M&amp;IE rate.
**


NOTE: Any meals/events where a staff member picks up the tab for a large group of professional associates may be charged to the company credit card and a receipt will be required. It the staff member received per diem then a % of the cost will be deducted from their next per diem disbursement. Refer to the handbook for further details.</field>

### Ask the ED: Adam Huttler (15 minutes)

**Q- How was your Hermitage? **

**A: **Great! It was good, tried best to be as productive as possible. I wanted to not make problems,  but I have no idea if was successful in that. Hopefully it is helpful. I got everything done that could be done. There are some areas of functionality that I wanted to steer clear of. Will do post mortem to check in on how things went.

**Q (Jason)- Will there be another stake of org memo? **

**A: **There probably should be, but unsure what the right occasion would be. 

**Q (Nathan)- Have you thought about re-estimating our reach? Now the membership has jumped. before it was neat to say that membership is 10% of reach, that we're reaching more people.**

**A- **Interesting to think about membership and reach in that way. I will take a look at this.

**Q (Caitlin)- Will there be a new Thematic Goal?**

**A-** Not now, there are still things that fall into general heading of SSO, but it has yet to be put under the heading of SSO. Will probably happen after director of programs is hired.

**Q (Jillian)- Can you talk a little bit about the restructuring with the Director of Programs?**

**A- **The basic concept is that the Director of Programs is being hired, they will report to me and the program directors will go to them. There will be two teams (programs team and institutions team) One of the mandates will to ensure that programs are stronger as whole than separately.

**Q (Malcolm): I know that you have had thoughts about Taylor Swift as leader in terms of copyright law, but how do those thoughts play into her being a figurehead of white feminism. **

**A-**I plead the 5th. I have to say that I don't really have enough information to answer this, but I would be open to discussing.

**Q (Tim): Can you talk a little bit about Singularity University? **

**A- **It will be at the end of Sept (26th-Oct 1) so will miss staff meeting. The singularity is increasingly popular idea having to do with the theory that information technology follows an exponential growth curve. Moores law (number of circuits doubles every few years). What's interesting with exponential growth curves is that they approach infinity. What happens when these things go vertical? Ex. what happens when a robot can make a robot twice as smart as itself in one day. Basic premise is compelling. Could be dramatic for humanity when it happens--in our lifetimes. Started by Google and other entrepreneurs, made to gather people  to talk about it. This is the first time doing something with Professional Development funds. It was interesting to explain to board. We need to think about these kinds of majorly disruptive technological updates. Hopefully we will learn cool things. There is a group of about 80 people.

**Q (Jason): As person who manages blog, I have noticed it needs some love. **

**A: **Yeah the blog sucks.  I would love to move it to medium, but I would like someone to transfer this to someone else to take charge on this. I would welcome this. 

**Jason-** Task force? **A-**maybe.

- You all got a message from Adam earlier this week, but I recognize that most of you haven't worked much with Createquity. Most places write articles week to week, but do not work on having a built a base of knowledge. We want to change this by having articles work towards similar goals. Looked at article written a little while ago.
- We have an editorial team of 9, and are looking at ways to collaborate. We are opening up Google+ group to Jason and Courtney. Thomas Cott will be using this too. If you have other ideas of how FA and cretequity can work together, let me know.

**b.	Health and Dental Enrollment (Nicola)**
- If you are currently not enrolled in our health and dental (Solstice and Health Republic) but would like to be, I wanted to let you know when the open enrollment is.
- Solstice: This month is open enrollment for coverage starting October 1
- Health Republic: People can join in December for January 1
- If you're interested, let me know and I'll give you the correct forms.

**c.	OkTECHberfest (Nicola)**
- We wanted to let you know that this is being planned and that things are in the works. 
- Shawn, Theresa, Caitlin, and I have been putting together the schedule. We will be getting a final schedule to everyone soon, but currently some things are in flux. 
-This year we want to bring more focus on &quot;Why we do the work we do&quot; and understanding our members and what they do.
- We really want to reduce stress on the work schedule. All standing meetings will be canceled for that week, and all the events will try and be scheduled to minimize conflict with normal work time.
- One of the things we are planning are Customer Service Ride-a-longs so we will be looking for CS volunteers. Look out for a request for volunteers for this soon. 
- If you own meetings, remove them for that week

**Maker Faire (Nicola)**

- I'm working on getting a table at Maker Faire. We missed the deadline, so at this point it's if they have space, but for now let's just assume that they do. It's September 26th and 27th from 10-6 each day. I'm looking for 2-3 people each day (preferably 2 shifts of people 10-2 and 2-6). You would get a lunch stipend for $20 and get to meet cool people. It looks like 10 people helped out last year. Let me know if you are in town that weekend and available to work one of the shifts. I'll send out an email with more details but I just want to know a general availability/interest.

**d.	Finance Report (Tim)**
- We have closed FY, I have added another line. Last time we talked about how we were tracking. We met all of our forecasts, but not great that we have not met our budget.
- The stock markets are shitty, this will hugely impact how we end the year. It could be pretty messy. Will find out when download statements. 
- (Adam)-a note on forecasts, forecasts were made 3 months ago. Good that we were good at guessing, but need to be better at predicting more in advance.
- FS has picked up past month. not sure if this is anomaly, or another trend.  Also, it's not just stock markets, we have $ in other places, but even a small percentage makes a big difference. Don't conflate volatility and risk. Timing is kind of ugly.

We are now in 401k blackout period. They're moving to Ritholtz. Once this is done, Jillian will start to talk to people who want to join.

**e.	How We Work (Tim)**


- Somewhere hidden in office are 13 laptops. Not a scavenger hunt. In about a day or so, these will get handed out. Make sure you are clearing everything off your computer.
 - Gary, Shawn, and Nicola are working on guidelines.
 - For now will stay in office.
 - It's been a big project, Nicola has been working on
- Office renovation- walls and floors proposal has come, hopefully will get furniture proposal tomorrow.

- This week is last summer Friday!
- The pope is coming to town end of September. On Friday Sept. 25th he will be doing mass from Madison sq. garden. City is figuring out major travel advisories.
 - 150 ft pope mural. check it out.



- Now that it's past Sept 1, we have entered new day off policy. Still ask for permission and put it on the calendar.
- Adam and Tim are still interviewing for the Director of Programs
- Made offer to PA, but did not accept. Felt like we weren't finding who we needed. If you have new names, send to Nicola so she can flag. 
 - We are looking for someone who doesn't look like us, someone who brings dimension to team. Think about people who bring spice. Start phone interviews at start of October.


### Wrap-Up &amp; May Actionables (5 Minutes) 

- Repeat from August:  If you have any money making ideas for Fiscal Sponsorship, let [Theresa] know.
- Repeat from August:  If you know of any filmmakers and big budget projects who would be interested in having investors, let [Theresa] know.
- Selena sent out a KB session invite, so take a look at the calendar invite and respond. You are welcome to attend, but it is not needed if you have already done. 
- If interested in play testing #ArtStartUp, fill out the survey that Jason sent around. For off-site people interested, play tesets will be done during OkTECHberfest.
- Let Ian know if you have ideas about other ways for FA and Createquity to work together.
- If you are interested in adding yourself or partners/children to health and dental, let Nicola know so she can get you the correct forms. (Dental needs to be finalized by October 1 so any forms need to be in by Sept 25th)
- Look out for an email requesting volunteers for OkTECHberfest customer service ride-a-longs.
- If you own meetings that will happen the week of OkTECHberfest, please cancel them.
- Let Nicola know your availability for Maker Faire (Sept 26th &amp; 27th) by filling out the form to be sent out by email.
- Tell Nicola if you have any new names of people applying for PA position so she can flag.

1. The Board reviews and approves the project 
2. The hybrid addendum is sent to the project to be signed

4. The project is marked in the database as having signed the hybrid addendum 
5. If we receive an investment or distribution agreement, Adam reviews it and authorizes staff to provide written consent that it's okay. In Adam's absence, Dianne will review and authorize staff to provide written consent with final approval from Adam or Tim.
6. Projects that have been marked as having signed the addendum will be asked a handful of additional questions in the annual report.</field>

		<field name="title">What SpaceFinder info is displayed on membership record?</field>
		<field name="content">### In order to create an account on SpaceFinder a person must sign up for a free community membership with Fractured Atlas. 

An account is NOT required to search for or request space, but it is required to do things [save a shortlist of searches to your dashboard](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/how-do-i-share-a-shortlist-of-spaces), or to create a listing. For those that sign up for venue accounts in order to create listings, a SpaceFinder tab will display on their Fractured Atlas member record.


![SpaceFinder info on member record](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=655 &quot;SpaceFinder info on member record&quot;)

### Important facts about info on the SpaceFinder tab:

- You will only see a SpaceFinder tab if the member has a venue account
- This data is pulled from SpaceFinder database when you refresh the member record
- 'Instance' tells you which regional SpaceFinder the member uses (i.e. NYC, Austin, D.C. etc.)
- The 'Venue Account' active link will take you to SpaceFinder
- If 'Venue Account' is empty it means the venue account is pending approval (or was deleted)

### Important info the SpaceFinder tab DOESN'T DISPLAY:

- You won't be able to tell if the member is paying booking fees to Fractured Atlas (i.e. a paying customer of SpaceFinder)
- You won't be able to see all of the members associated with that venue account

### Key Take-Aways

- SpaceFinder database is in a separate location (and form) than the Fractured Atlas database.
- A member who has a $0 lifetime value and a SpaceFinder tab, could be a paying customer
- A member might be using &amp; loving SpaceFinder to rent space, but not have a tab on their record
- When in doubt, don't assume just ping one of the SpaceFinder PAs

		<field name="content">### Approving new listings across SpaceFinder websites is a daily administrative task, usually managed by a SpaceFinder Program Associate.

If you are being trained to approve listings, you will be taught in person. This handy checklist below is for reference _after_ training.


Before approving a listing for publish:


- Confirm venue did not create a duplicate account
- Edit space name if it has useless &quot;craigs list-like&quot; descriptive key words (i.e. &quot;dance studio downtown CHEAP!&quot; should be edited to be &quot;dance studio&quot;)
- Check for typos in the organization information and test website link
- Check basic description for typos and edit for clarity
- Check hourly and long term rates for accuracy
- If no photos are added, then visit venue webpage, Facebook, etc. to see if you can include any. 
- Select a primary photo that will best represent the listing in search results (well lit, or high contract photos are best, do not select logos)


*Note: Certain regional teams (such as Bay Area and certain Canadian instances) prefer to approve their own listings, check with a supervisor for details.*</field>

Below is a list of questions to help identify if the organization is indeed a good match, and also prime the warm hand off to the FA staff member who manages Open Arts Network. 

1. Who are your primary constituents for membership? Institutions? Individual artists? 
1. How would you describe your organizations relationship with your members? (i.e. high touch vs low touch, incubator vs training, curator/artist vs service provider/client, etc.)
1. How many members do you have?
1. What are your members pressing needs? 
1. What professional development/admin infrastructure support do you currently provide in your programming? 
1. How might Fractured Atlas's services buttress or optimize your offerings?
1. How do you envision your organization/membership growing?
1. What segments are most likely to grow?

		<field name="title">Setting up Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)</field>
		<field name="content">Before a project can release funds from Fractured Atlas, they must first set up Electronic Fund Transfer. Projects can access the EFT Signup Form at My Fiscal Sponsorship --&gt; Fund Releases --&gt; Sign Up for EFT. They can complete the form and return it to our staff along with a voided check. If a project does not have physical checks for their account, they can send the first page of their bank statement or a letter from their bank. It needs to be official bank documentation that confirms the account and routing numbers, account holder name and address.

Once we receive the form, a staff member will manually enter the EFT information (account and routing numbers, and whether the account is personal or business) under the FS Tab in the Helpdesk. The information should be entered first by looking at the check or official documentation, and then checking that against the information provided on the form. If there's any discrepancy, the staff member should reach out to the project to clarify account and routing numbers. With written permission from the project, the staff member can make edits to the EFT form. Once numbers are entered, the staff member will then save the form in the customer record (date.EFT Signup.projectname). The staff member should then e-mail the project to confirm that EFT has been set up, and that the account and routing numbers are accurate - there's boilerplate for this under the tag, f.s. eft.</field>

		<field name="title">Annual Reports</field>
		<field name="content">* General Info

All fiscally sponsored projects are required to submit an annual report detailing how funds disbursed over the prior calendar year were spent. Projects are sent an automated email on or around January 1st informing them that the report is due by April 1st. They are sent two other reminder emails prior to the deadline.

Only fiscally sponsored projects who have released funds in a given calendar year are required to submit the annual report. Projects who received donations but did not release funds are not required to submit a report.

Projects can access their Annual Report online through our website by logging-in and following My Stuff--&gt;My Fiscal Sponsorship--&gt;Info/Reports. The report is automatically available to projects once they release funds, although they should not submit it until the calendar year ends or they terminate. 

If a project does not submit their annual report by April 1st, their fiscal sponsorship will be frozen, meaning that they cannot process new donations or request new fund releases. Their sponsorship will be unfrozen upon receipt of the report. A fiscal sponsorship staff member needs to manually unfreeze the project - this does not happen automatically.

Staff can view a project's annual report on their CRM under the Fiscal Sponsorship tab. There are staff permissions to edit and delete annual reports. It is almost never necessary to delete an annual report, so please consider very carefully before doing so.

*Report Components

** Project Impact

The Project Impact portion consists of a narrative with three prompts:
- Please describe the activities of your project in 20XX. Please share any relevant milestones, achievements, or challenges.
- Please describe the people that experienced your work.
- What are your plans for the project for 20XX? (the following calendar year)

Projects are asked to review the description they submitted when they applied for fiscal sponsorship. If the description no longer accurately reflects the work that they are doing, they have the opportunity let us know so that we can follow up with them about submitting a revised fiscal sponsorship application for re-approval by our Board of Directors.

Finally, under Project Impact, fiscally sponsored projects enter in numbers about who participated in their work.
- How many people paid to experience your work?
- How many people experienced your work for free?
- Artists Served

** Project Spending

Using the same Expense Category budget line items that are used in the Fund Release Request procedure, projects report their expenditures from the previous calendar year.

They are also asked to estimate the percentage of their total project spending that fell into each category. The total must equal 100%.
- Fundraising
- Management and general
- Programs and services

Finally, they are asked to estimate what percentage of their spending went directly toward paying artists.

** Project Revenue

Fiscally sponsored projects are asked to provide a breakdown of their income. Funds processed through their fiscal sponsorship program are pre-populated into the relevant fields (Individual contributions/Grants and corporate contributions).

If, after the project enters their expenses and income, there's a surplus on the report, the project is asked to provide a description of how their surplus will be spent.

** Work Samples &amp; Documentation

Fiscally sponsored projects have the opportunity to send links and/or upload up to 64 MB of files that are work samples. This is an optional portion of the report.

* Review Procedure

The fiscal sponsorship team regularly reviews annual reports in &quot;sprints&quot; during the months of January-April as reports are coming in. 

Review consists of reading through the report narrative and reviewing the updated financials.

[edit]Terminated Members

Sometimes the project will terminate before they have filed the annual report. We have a link that they can use to access just the report, without reactivating the membership. The link is www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/report2008 and add '?termed_fs_id=XXX' to the end (where XXX is the id number for the terminated project).

For example, you could send something like: www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/report2007?termed_fs_id=197

That url would invite Tia Shearer or her cohorts to submit an annual report for FY2007. Remember to change the year for the annual report that is due.

[edit]Active Members

For projects who want to have their project returned to active status, have them submit the report through the website, and then a staff person will review the report and reactivate them.

		<field name="title">Nonprofit Rate Requests</field>
		<field name="content">Sponsored projects are often eligible to receive discounts from vendors who have a policy of offering a &quot;nonprofit rate&quot;. For these kinds of requests, we need to have the name and mailing address of the vendor and the purpose of the request on file so we know what kind of letter to give and how best to provide the information.

In order to request a discounted rate, projects should send our Staff the contact person, company name and address so that we can create a letter requesting the rate in their behalf. There is a boilerplate document found here: Q:\Fiscal Sponsorship\Sales Tax Exempt and Nonprofit Rate Docs - this should be used as a template for the request. The document should be created, saved as a pdf within the Member Folder and then sent to the project so they can send it to the vendor directly. If there are supplemental documents needed (IRS Determination Letter, W-9, etc) they should be attached to the letter and sent as one PDF document.</field>

		<field name="content">**Application Requirements**

[Applications for fiscal sponsorship](/site/fiscal/apply_instructions) are only available online to professional and organizational members of Fractured Atlas. Our fiscal sponsorship application requests the following information:

Name of Legal Entity Responsible (it may be an individual or a company)
SSN or EIN (For an individual we need an SSN; for an unincorporated group or corporation we need an EIN)
Project Name (It should be the name used for fundraising purposes)
Project Discipline (There is a drop down menu of options)
Temporary or Ongoing
Project description (Note: Any future changes to this section need to be approved by our Board)
Public Benefit
Online Profile Text (All sponsored projects are profiled on our website. This should be a general description of the artist or group. Projects may update this section anytime through our website)
Summary of Artist Qualifications/Group history
Budget
Fundraising Prospects, if any (foundations, corporations or individual donors)
Whether or not any investors who are not also creative participants will be involved in the project

**Application Timeline**

Applications are reviewed monthly. The deadline for application is 11:59PM EST of the last day of each month. The Executive Committee of the Board meets sometime within the first two weeks of the following month (usually the first Tuesday) to review and vote on applications. Once applications have been approved by the Board, the applicants will receive their notice of approval via email with the fiscal sponsorship instruction packet attached as a PDF. Our goal is to get the approval packet to new projects by the 15th of the month.

**Application Approval Procedure**

Every new application for fiscal sponsorship is to be sent an email confirmation from the program staff stating that the application was received and will be reviewed at the next Board meeting. The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors make up the review panel for all sponsorship applications. All applications are marked &quot;Pending&quot; in the fiscal sponsorship admin panel until Board approval.

All pending applications must be reviewed by our staff prior to the Executive Committee's meeting to monitor any red flags that may exist in the application. If any red flags are found, it is best to contact the member, request clarification and explain that this is necessary to help the application receive approval. Staff should grade the projects as the following:

A - The application should be approved. The staff is confident that the project is a good fit for the fiscal sponsorship program and meets all criteria for approval.  

B - The application warrants extra scrutiny by the board. While the staff believes the application meets the criteria for approval, there is something in the application that is unusual or a-typical.

C - The application warrants close, skeptical scrutiny by the board. The staff is concerned that the application may not meet the criteria for approval.

N - This application should be denied. The staff is confident that the project is not a good fit for the fiscal sponsorship program and that application does not meet the criteria for approval.

Staff should send their assessment of the current round of applications one week prior to the Executive Director so he may alert the Committee to any applications requiring extra scrutiny.

Once the Board approves a project, the admin panel should be updated to reflect &quot;approved&quot; instead of &quot;pending&quot;. This will generate the automatic link we provide on our website for online donations.

Projects that have been approved will be automatically emailed a fiscal sponsorship instruction packet for their review and records. This email consists of a copy of the Pre-Authorized Grant Agreement and the full Instructions.

Staff must track each project that applies (regardless of approval or denial) for the Ex. Director's quarterly report to the Board of Directors. The report can be found in Q:\Board of Directors\Meeting Supplements\FS Supplementals. The report should include the project name, member name, geographic location, a short statement of activities, the staff recommendation and the Executive Committee's decision. The Executive Director can pull an excel spreadsheet after each set of project approvals containing project name, project description, and state that needs to be edited by the program staff. This spreadsheet should be updated each month by program staff.</field>

		<field name="title">Materials for the Arts Procedure</field>
		<field name="content">If you are receiving an inquiry about access to Materials For The Arts, you should first verify that the project is currently fiscally sponsored by us. If they are, you should direct the sponsored project to visit the Materials for the Arts website ([www.mfta.org](http://www.mfta.org)) to review the program guidelines and determine eligibility. There is an online application for the artist/arts organization can then fill out. Once they have successfully submitted this form, MFTA will ask the sponsored project to submit an official letter of request to Ms. Harriet Taub at MFTA, as well as supporting documentation of ongoing arts or cultural programming in NYC for at least a year (this would be in the form of brochures, flyers, etc.). 

Typically, after the project has done these steps, a representative from MFTA would email us requesting a sponsorship letter for a newly registered applicant. The template for this letter can be found in the shared drive → Programs and Services → Fiscal Sponsorship → MFTA → MFTA_Letter_w_Header. If you open up that document, you can replace the two highlighted sections with the name of the fiscally sponsored project. You would then need to save this document on the desktop (or some other folder where you saves documents) as a PDF file formatted as such &quot;YYYY-MM-DD.MFTA Sponsorship Letter.Project Name&quot;. An example of the proper format is as follows:

**2015-10-15.MFTA Sponsorship Letter.7 Train Murals.pdf**

You will also want to upload a copy of the PDF sponsorship letter in the member's files (click the folder icon near the top of the member's account, next to the Quick Actions dropdown menu) before sending it to Hallie Bahn at hbahn@mfta.nyc.gov or whoever from MFTA contacted us for the letter.

If the project has already 1)submitted the online MFTA application and 2) sent in their official letter of request and supporting documentation to MFTA, then feel free to send the sponsorship letter to Hallie Bahn at hbahn@mfta.nyc.gov and info@mfta.nyc.gov.

Membership for our projects at MFTA needs to be renewed annually: MFTA will occasionally send FA an email when a project's membership has expired. Sometimes a project will contact us directly for the updated letter. Once again, just check that a project is still actively sponsored before sending out a new letter to MFTA. In the latter case, you will want to check the member's files to see whether an updated sponsorship letter has been submitted recently to MFTA on the project's behalf or not.</field>

All fiscally sponsored projects are required to submit an annual report detailing how funds disbursed over the prior calendar year were spent. Projects are sent an automated email on or around January 1st informing them that the report is due by April 1st. They are sent two other reminder emails prior to the deadline.

Projects are asked to report on all funds handled by their arts practice in a calendar year, even those that were not handled by Fractured Atlas or our fiscal sponsorship program. This helps for our data collection purposes to have an accurate picture of the project's size, scope, and real-world impact in their communities and disciplines. Additional funds included on the annual report are not reported as income to the IRS or charged our 7% administrative fee.

Only fiscally sponsored projects who have released funds in a given calendar year are required to submit the annual report. Projects who received donations but did not release funds are not required to submit a report.

Projects can access their Annual Report online through our website by logging-in and following My Stuff--&gt;My Fiscal Sponsorship--&gt;Info/Reports. The report is automatically available to projects once they release funds, although they should not submit it until the calendar year ends or they terminate. 

If a project does not submit their annual report by April 1st, their fiscal sponsorship will be frozen, meaning that they cannot process new donations or request new fund releases. Their sponsorship will be unfrozen upon receipt of the report. A fiscal sponsorship staff member needs to manually unfreeze the project - this does not happen automatically.

Staff can view a project's annual report on their CRM under the Fiscal Sponsorship tab. There are staff permissions to edit and delete annual reports. It is almost never necessary to delete an annual report, so please consider very carefully before doing so.

#Report Components

##Project Impact

The Project Impact portion consists of a narrative with three prompts:
- Please describe the activities of your project in 20XX. Please share any relevant milestones, achievements, or challenges.
- Please describe the people that experienced your work.
- What are your plans for the project for 20XX? (the following calendar year)
These prompts have a 100-word limit.

Projects are asked to review the description they submitted when they applied for fiscal sponsorship. If the description no longer accurately reflects the work that they are doing, they have the opportunity let us know so that we can follow up with them about submitting a revised fiscal sponsorship application for re-approval by our Board of Directors.

Finally, under Project Impact, fiscally sponsored projects enter in numbers about who participated in their work. 
- How many people paid to experience your work?
- How many people experienced your work for free?
- Artists Served

##Project Spending

Using the same Expense Category budget line items that are used in the Fund Release Request procedure, projects report their expenditures from the previous calendar year.

They are also asked to estimate the percentage of their total project spending that fell into each category. The total must equal 100%.
- Fundraising
- Management and general
- Programs and services

Finally, they are asked to estimate what percentage of their spending went directly toward paying artists.

##Project Revenue

Fiscally sponsored projects are asked to provide a breakdown of their income. Funds processed through their fiscal sponsorship program are pre-populated into the relevant fields (Individual contributions/Grants and corporate contributions).

If, after the project enters their expenses and income, there's a surplus on the report, the project is asked to provide a description of how their surplus will be spent.

##Work Samples &amp; Documentation

Fiscally sponsored projects have the opportunity to send links and/or upload up to 64 MB of files that are work samples. This is an optional portion of the report.

#Review Procedure

The fiscal sponsorship team regularly reviews annual reports in &quot;sprints&quot; during the months of January-April as reports are coming in. 

Review consists of reading through the report narrative and reviewing the updated financials. Staff can compare the reported expenses with the project's fund release history, which appear side-by-side during staff review. If the project reported less expenditures in a given Expense Category, the line will appear red in the report. Staff should review the report to confirm that funds were put to different Expense Categories. For example, if our fund release history indicates that a project released $10,000 for *Contract labor: artists* but then only reported $8,000 in *Contract labor: artists* expenditures on the report, we will want to see that the remaining $2000 were used for other expenses.

Staff can either click 'Approve' or 'Place on Hold' upon review. For projects that show a mismatch between the project's fund release history and the reported expenses, it is important to briefly note on the report what changes were made. For example: &quot;Funds released for Contract labor: artists were put toward other expenses, like Production and exhibition or Advertising and marketing.&quot;

Reports would be placed on hold if it were unclear how all funds released the previous calendar year were used, if there's a large surplus on the report that's unaccounted for, or if the narrative raises any red flags regarding prohibited activities outlined in our program manual.

Reports where the respondent indicated that their project description had changed can be approved if there are no other questions. Staff need to promptly follow up with these respondents to see if they need to submit a revised application for re-approval by our Board of Directors.

#Terminated Members

Sometimes a project's fiscal sponosrship will terminate before they have filed the annual report. We have a link that they can use to access the report, without reactivating their sponsorship. The link is www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/report20XX?termed_fs_id=YYYY to the end (where XX is the year of the report and YYYY is the ID number for the terminated project).

#Active Members

For projects who want to have their project returned to Active status, have them submit the report through the website, and then a staff person will review the report and reactivate them.

#Historical Info on Annual Reports

The Annual Report requirement has evolved over the years. Here are a few things to keep in mind for context.

Reports submitted in FY11 or prior will appear quite different. The Expense Category budget line items used in the fund release request process were changed to map to data on expenditures collected by the CDP and the annual report changed accordingly.

The narrative portion of the report has also been refined. The three writing prompts did not exist prior to 2014.

We used to require that fiscally sponsored projects base their reports on our fiscal year (September to August). This frequently resulted in confusion from projects that have a different fiscal year or use the calendar year for budgeting and financial reporting purposes. In 2013, it was decided to switch the annual report from our fiscal year to the calendar year. To accommodate this and bridge the gap between reports, we had projects submit a 'Mini Report' for the months of September through December of 2013. The Mini Report was administered through SurveyMonkey and was a condensed version of our annual report.

		<field name="content">###How a Sponsored Project Can Request Funds

- Login at www.fracturedatlas.org  
- Go to My Fiscal Sponsorship --&gt; Fund Releases --&gt; Request Funds  
- Projects will need to select from the drop-down menu of expense categories to indicate how they expect the funds will be spent. They can select multiple expense categories in a single fund release request, and should specify the amount that needs to be released toward each expense. Explanations of these expense categories can be found on the Fund Release Request page.  
- If the fund release request is $5,000 or more, the project should also upload supporting documentation of those expenses, to be reviewed by our staff prior to release.

###Reviewing Fund Releases

1. An FA staff member will review all fund release requests on a daily basis. Pending fund release requests can be reviewed under Transactions Processing in the Helpdesk (Fiscal Sponsorship --&gt; Pending Fund Releases). This person should check how all fund releases were reported - if any were categorized as &quot;other&quot; in the expense categories, the staff member should follow up with the project to try to determine a more appropriate line item for the fund release. There's boilerplate for this, under f.s. fund releases.

2. All fund releases over $5,000 require documentation of expenses (receipts, contracts, quotes, invoices, etc), but we reserve the right to request documentation at any time. First time fund releases of $3,500+ require documentation as well.

3. For fund releases of $3,500 - $4,999, check to see if the project has previously submitted documentation (will be saved in the customer record). If they have, it’s not necessary to follow up to request further documentation, even if no documentation was included as part of this request. If they have not previously provided documentation, follow up with the project to request it.

4. If a fund release request is $5,000 or more, search the fund release request ID in Zimbra history – an automated e-mail is generated at the time the request is submitted. If documentation was uploaded to the request form, it will be attached to the automated e-mail. Documentation should be saved in the customer record using the following file format:  
[Date].Fund Release Docs.[Fund Release Request #]  
Ex. 2015-04-22.Fund Release Docs.53975  

5. If documentation is not included as part of the request, contact the project and ask them to provide signed contracts, invoices, receipts, or quotes. There is boilerplate under the f.s. fund release documentation tag. Add a flag to the request by including a note in the fund release notice on the member’s FS page in the HD, using the following format:  
[Date] Documentation Requested – [initials]  
Ex. 4/22/15 Documentation Requested – AK

6. Documentation should include the following information:
•	date (must be after fiscal sponsorship approval)  
•	the contractor/employee/vendor name  
•	the project or company name  
•	the goods exchanged or services provided  
•	the agreed upon compensation/price/fee  
The documentation should also be signed by both parties whenever possible.  

7. In the event that the project does not have documentation for all requested funds but needs the funds in advance of making purchases, the staff member can ask that they send:
•	any documentation they may already have (quotes, screenshots, invoices), and/or  
•	a budget for anticipated expenses, and/or  
•	a timeline for when they expect the expenses will be incurred  
If the above can be provided at that time, the staff member may submit the request and follow up with the project according to the agreed upon timeline.

8. There are some projects for whom documentation is required for every request, regardless of the amount requested. Reasons for this include:
•	a funder requires us to keep full documentation  
•	they have not provided full documentation for a previous release if we required it  
•	we have concerns that they may be operating in a for-profit manner  
•	someone (typically a donor or collaborator) has raised a concern about the way the project handles funds

9. Fund releases are approved on a daily basis by the Program Director or Program Specialist. Once fund releases are approved, it typically takes about 1-3 business days for the funds to transfer to the project's bank account.

###Fund Release via Wire Transfers
This is generally discouraged and only done on a case by case basis when a project needs funds sent to a company overseas or in an emergency situation where a delay in releasing funds through a check will be prohibitive to a project's successful completion of their activities. To execute a wire transfer, a project must submit a fund release request as with all other releases. After this is done, they should send all of the information listed below to the program staff (which will be forwarded to the Deputy Director and Controller).

		<field name="title">TDF Costume Collection Procedure</field>
		<field name="content">If you are receiving an inquiry about access to TDF Costume Collection, you should first verify that the project is currently fiscally sponsored by us. If they are, you can send the boilerplate steps and two documents: a Blank Letter of Agreement and the CC Authorization form. You will find these documents to attach by going to the shared drive → Programs and Services → Fiscal Sponsorship → COSTUME COLLECTION → &quot;Blank LOA. TDF&quot; and &quot;Credit Card Authorization. TDF Costume Collection&quot;

The boilerplate is asking for the project's production information that we prefer to have in an email reply back. The reason for this is because on our end, we will have to fill out the PDF document of the TDF Costume Collection Letter of Agreement (LoA) with the project's details. This is what is asked for in an email reply back from the member:

Sponsored Project's Name  
Name of production  
Size of house  
Authorized Designer or Contact Person  
Email for contact person  
Performance Dates  
Return Dates (CC policy states they are due 10 days after the final performance)  

After the project sends us the production info and the completed CC form, you can find the LoA we need to send to TDF by going to the shared drive → Programs and Services → Fiscal Sponsorship → COSTUME COLLECTION → &quot;Current Letter of Agreement. TDF Costume Collection&quot;. Click Tools → Typewriter → Typewriter. Use your cursor and edit the following sections of this LoA (examples of added sections via Typewriter tool are in bold):

Company: Fractured Atlas, Inc. (fiscally sponsoring **PROJECT NAME)**  
Title of Production: **NAME OF PRODUCTION**  
Authorized Designer(s): **JANE DOE 555-555-5555**  
Company Billing Address: **Fractured Atlas, 248 West 35th Street, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10001**  
Seating Capacity: **NUMBER** or write in **FILM**  
1st Preview Date: **2015/10/01**  
Opening Date: **2015/10/02**  
Closing Date: **2015/10/13**  
(on second page of LoA)  
Date:** September 20, 2015**

After the LoA is completed by you, you will need to combine it with the completed CC form. As with MFTA Sponsorship Letters, you should save a copy of the PDF on your desktop somewhere and upload a copy of it to the member's files. The file should be saved in this format: &quot;YYYY-MM-DD.TDF Costume Collection.Project Name&quot;. An example of the proper format is as follows:

**2015-10-15.TDF Costume Collection.Live Source.pdf**

You can then email the PDF document to Craig Steuker at costume@tdf.org and confirm with the project that you have sent it (there is boilerplate text for this).</field>

		<field name="title">Processing Stock Donations</field>
		<field name="content">**Processing Stock Donation**  

To initiate a donation of stock, Fractured Atlas staff must speak with the donor directly. When we have contact with the donor, we should email them the following information about our brokerage account which they should pass on to their broker:  

- Charles Schwab  
- DTC # 0164  
- Code 40  
- FBO: Fractured Atlas Productions, Inc.  
- Account number: 2800-1541  
- Problems, Charles Schwab Transfer of Assets Team: 877-328-0276  

The donor should let us know when they’ve initiated the transfer so we can alert the Controller and the Deputy Director to keep an eye out for the transfer. Once it posts to our account, the Deputy Director will email you a screenshot of the account activity. 

When we email the brokerage information to the donor, we should also email them the stock donation letter. This can be found here: Q://Programs and Services/Fiscal Sponsorship/Donor Materials. **Be sure to enter the project’s title before sending the letter to the donor.** This letter states the amount of shares they are giving, the company issuing the stock and the date it was transferred to Fractured Atlas's brokerage account. The donor doesn't need to include the value of the stock, since it's a publicly traded security with an objective market value. This letter will need to be received in our offices before we can process the donation

Donation Receipt: **The donor's receipt should only list the shares, the ticker symbol, and the date of the transfer.** Make sure to enter this information into the &quot;Non-cash/stock description&quot; on the transaction page when processing the donation. Example: 12 Shares of IBM on 12/24/2014.

To Process Stock Donations: When the pending donation is ready to be processed on Fractured Atlas's end, Fractured Atlas staff should process the gift manually. The figure to use is the actual closing value of the donated shares on the date of the transaction. To find this information:

1. Visit www.bigcharts.com
2. Click Historical Quotes
3. Enter the ticker symbol and date of the transfer.

This can only be done after the stock transfer is complete. In addition to including the cash value of the stock in the &quot;Donation Amount&quot; field, the stock donation option should be selected, and then the description of the donation should be entered into the description field. Once the transaction has been processed, email the Controller with the donation ID.

		<field name="title">Giving Level Review</field>
		<field name="content">Giving levels are available for fiscally-sponsored projects on the Fractured Atlas website so you can offer gifts in exchange for donations. The giving levels live on the project profile. We strongly encourage projects to use giving levels to define standard contribution levels for their donors and offer reward packages in return. These are easy to add and hide from the My Fiscal Sponsorship section of the website. 

Once a project submits their giving levels for review, they are unavailable to the project for editing. If the project wishes to make substantial edits before approval, you can suggest deleting the levels and resubmitting - this allows for the project to have greater control of the copy. Once any giving level has been used by a donor, staff should not delete the giving level. This ensures that we have accurate records of donations received should any issues or questions about a donation arise. We frequently have donors reach back out to verify the specifics of a donation. Older giving levels should be made invisible if the project no longer wishes them to be active.

Staff reviews the giving levels for the following:

- The goods or services being offered in exchange for the donation are not prohibited by the terms of fiscal sponsorship.
- The &quot;Non-Gift Amount&quot; of any goods or services being offered in exchange for the donation is included in the correct place.
- The &quot;Non-Gift Amount&quot; of any goods or services being offered in exchange for the donation is less than the total amount of the donation.</field>

### Creating a Release to Test

* Go to trunk/
* Compress that directory
* RENAME the zip file to &quot;artfully-widget.zip&quot;
* **Deactivate** and **delete** any old Artful.ly plugins on your Wordpress install
* Upload artfully-widget.zip to your installation

### Releasing to WP Plugin Directory

Because we host the code on Github but AP uses SVN, there are some hoops to jump through. If you've never done this before, follow instructions here to clone the git repo in the proper way: https://gist.github.com/gmoore/af4c2abf86d3f646ffff

We use Git SVN

The workflow:

* Do some work
* git add
* git commit
* git svn rebase (This can take a long time, sometimes up to an hour)
* git svn dcommit

If your &quot;git svn rebase&quot; fails, check here: http://blog.victorquinn.com/fix-git-svn-in-mountain-lion</field>

		<field name="title">Making Your Space More Inclusive and Accessible: Resources</field>
		<field name="content">Did you know that 20% of the population identifies as having a disability, making disabled people America’s largest minority? According to New York City's Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities, New York City alone is home to more than 800,000. Did you know that disabled people have a reported $220 billion in discretionary income? Yet despite these numbers, disabled people represent a hugely underserved market, and that includes the thousands of disabled artists living and making work throughout the five boroughs. But the opportunity for you to connect with this vibrant and growing community of artists is lost if they can’t get through your doors.

While increasing your customer base may be your primary goal, making your venue accessible is about more than simply complying with legal requirements; it  should celebrate the positive benefits of running a universally inclusive space. Improving the accessibility of your space and fostering a more inclusive environment can yield benefits that strengthen the culture of your venue from the top down.

**How can I benefit from making my space more accessible and inclusive?**

- More artists will be able to rent, rehearse and create in your space;
- More patrons will be able to attend your productions;
- Disabled artists and audience members will recommend your venue to others in the community; and
- Your space will be recommended by and recognized among artists as a place where the inclusionary impulse is celebrated and great work is made.

## Where do I begin?

At Fractured Atlas, because our SpaceFinder NYC directory is home to thousands of spaces—some conventional, some not so conventional—we understand that New York City presents both unique opportunities and challenges when it comes to finding places to make compelling work. Whether you’re creating a site-specific piece on a boat or hosting an event in a turn-of-the-century church with no elevator, or even renting a studio in a building that isn’t your own, there are things you can do to improve accessibility While you likely won’t be able to take all of these steps and/or totally renovate your space, understanding how you can accommodate disabled artists and patrons and is a great starting point to move your space toward a more inclusive environment for all artists. 

## Evaluate Your Space

Developed by disabled artists exclusively for SpaceFinder NYC, we encourage you to use [this checklist](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=731) as a guide as you walk through your space. While it's not exhaustive and some of the considerations on the list may not apply to your venue,  it will help you look at your space with an eye on accessibility and inclusiveness.  

There are many accessibility checklists available online. These are a couple of our favorites:

- [Checklist for Existing Facilities, Adaptive Environments, Inc.](http://www.ada.gov/racheck.pdf)
- [New Jersey Theatre Alliance’s Self Assessment](https://njtheatrealliance.org/accessibility/self-assessment)
- [Web Accessibility Initiative's Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php)

## Engaging Disabled Artists and Patrons: Make Accessibility Information Clear

Addressing accessibility features is not just for audience members, but also for renters and artists interested in using your space. By making information about your space’s accessibility clear, you’re helping your organization to reach a wider audience and increasing it’s visibility.

- If it’s not already accessible, take steps to make your website accessible. (See bullet 3 above)
- Include as much information as possible about your space’s accessibility features wherever you advertise it: your website, social media, SpaceFinder, etc.
- Make accessibility information easy to find on your website. Don’t bury it ‘below the fold’, so to speak.
- Familiarize staff with these features so that anyone can have a conversation with a prospective disabled renter or patron. 

## From the New Jersey Theatre Alliance: best practices for addressing accessibility

- Address every issue and policy with the question: Does this provide equal access for everyone?
- Mandatory nondiscrimination
- Consider accessibility in all routine parts of day/operations.
- Apply accessibility law to all functions.
- Establish an advisory committee or enlist a staff member who can be seen as an expert and can field questions from the disability community.
- Barrier removal: Provision of reasonable modifications to achieve a basic standard for architectural access and equal access to employment, programs, services for all visitors.
- Budget for accessibility.

It's also available for download [here.] (/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=731)

## General points to consider:

**What is the experience like for a disabled person creating in your space?**

- Can everyone access the venue easily?
- Is your staff knowledgeable of accessibility features? Are they welcoming and accommodating to patrons with multiple needs?
- Is your space welcoming to all disability communities? (Consider physical access and overall inclusiveness.)
- Which communities do you feel would be best served in your space?

### Venue Entrance

- Is the venue near an accessible public transportation stop? 
- Is it near a route of travel that does not require stairs?
- Is the main entrance wheelchair accessible? If not, is there an alternate entrance, elevator, or ramp? If yes, where is the entrance, elevator or ramp located? (e.g., next to main entrance, in alley, side of building, basement, etc.)
(Note: Wheelchair accessible means that the entrance to the building is completely flat. One step up makes the entrance inaccessible to many wheelchair users.)
- Can alternate accessible entrance be used independently of venue staff?

		<field name="title">Writing a Great Space Recommendation </field>
		<field name="content">Thank you for your interest in writing a recommendation for a space listed on SpaceFinder. SpaceFinder has repurposed our reviews feature so disabled artists can recommend spaces that are best practice examples of accessibility and inclusiveness. Any SpaceFinder user looking for space will be able to see recommendations. 

Recommendations are also how spaces get added to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nyc.spacefinder.org/communities/DisabilityNYCDance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Disability and Dance Workspace Directory&lt;/a&gt; being piloted in New York City.

Where do you enjoy making work or performing? Help make SpaceFinder as useful as possible to other artists by writing a recommendation for it!

**Recommendations on SpaceFinder:**
- Give details from a personal perspective that help identify positive factors for working with the space.
- Help others to understand how the space helped meet your needs.
- Provide peer disabled artists with accessibility information that might not otherwise be on the venue's listing or website.
- Include details regarding which communities will be best served by working in the space.

## How to Write a Recommendation

**To write a recommendation, you must either log into your SpaceFinder account, or [create a free membership.](https://cas.fracturedatlas.org/signups/new?service=http://nyc.spacefinder.org/dashboard)**

1. Visit the venue's listing.
2. On the righthand side of the page, under **Options**, select **Read/Submit Reviews**. 

 ![Submit Review Button on Listing](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=690 &quot;Submit Review Button on Listing&quot;)

3. Then, select **Write a Review**.
4. Next, log in if you have an existing SpaceFinder account, or create a free account to write your recommendation.
5. Once you've written your review, be sure to check the recommendation box if you think you'd recommend the space to other disabled artists.

## Tips For Writing A Helpful Recommendation

For others to get the most out of your recommendation, be as thorough as possible about your experience with the venue. 

**Some general questions to consider:**

- What made working in the space a positive experience? Be specific.
- Can everyone access the venue easily?
- Is staff knowledgeable about accessibility features?
- Is the space welcoming to all disability communities? (Consider physical access and overall inclusiveness.)
- Which communities do you feel would be best served in the space?

Before reviewing a space, keep in mind that the most effective recommendations will provide helpful information for patrons from all disability communities. To get an idea of various features to consider, take a look at [this checklist](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=730) -- or even better, print it out and take it with you! That being said, **a simple 'thumbs up' recommendation, is better than nothing!**

Of course, a recommendation with lots of detail is best, but even a simple recommendation helps make SpaceFinder a more useful tool for other artists.

### Need some examples? Check out this excerpt from a recommendation:

&quot;Though the theater is not wheelchair accessible, being downstairs, once inside the space is very negotiable and manageable for blind and low-vision patrons. In particular, access to the stage from the tiny green room is level, which provides great comfort! The same can be said about the level stage—the spectators being raised above in tiered seating. For a small theater, they have a great sound system and very nice lighting. Another benefit to producing here is the proximity of the stage to the sound/lighting booth making communication easy.&quot;

## Subscribing a Fan to Your Mailing List

If a fan has given you the okay to add their email to your mailing list, you can subscribe them immediately from Artful.ly. Anti-spam laws require subscribers to opt-into or request to join your mailing list, so make sure that this process is clear to your patrons. To learn more about MailChimp's guidelines and review their definition of permission, read their article [here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/compliance-tips/guidelines-for-list-compliance?&amp;_ga=1.215225951.913571212.1401485725).

Subscribing can be done either in bulk from a list segment, or by viewing an individual record in your database. This article provides detailed instructions on the various methods: [Adding People to MailChimp Lists or Groups](/site/knowledgebase/adding-people-to-mailchimp-lists-or-groups)

*Note: This method does **not** send an email confirmation to the individual, since they've already given you permission. If they haven't yet given you permission, see below for details on sending an invitation.*

## Inviting a Fan to Your Mailing List

Have new people interested in your work, and want to tell them how they can keep up-to-date with your organization? Send them an invitation to join your mailing list. MailChimp recommends a [double opt-in process](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/the-double-opt-in-process) to avoid any compliance issues. Just like subscribing your fans, sending them an invitation to subscribe to your mailing list can be done either in bulk from a list segment, or by viewing individual records in your Artful.ly database. 

*Note: This will send each person an email asking whether or not they'd like to join your mailing list. They will not be subscribed until the invitation has been accepted.*

		<field name="content">With the Relationships kit activated, you can now indicate which individuals in your database are employed by which companies. To further clarify who to contact for your staff, there is a &quot;Primary Contact&quot; relationship type. This only works between an individual and a company record in your database. For example, if you're working with a grants officer at a foundation, it's a good idea to list them as your primary contact there. That way, when someone views their record, they'll know who to to reach out to.

## From an individual's record
1. Visit the person's record and select the **Work with...** button to edit their information.
2. Select the **Relationships** tab on the left.
3. Click on the drop down menu and select the **Primary contact for** relationship type.
4. Start typing the name of the company. Artful.ly will suggest companies in your database, select the correct one and save your changes.

This is a way of giving recognition to an individual or organization who might have been involved in the donation in some way. For example, if a business has a donation match program, when you log their donation in your Artful.ly database, you can add a soft credit to the employee who works there.

## Donations can be soft credited...
- From a newly logged donation on a campaign.
- By adding a &quot;Gave&quot; action, or a manually logged donation on an individual's record.
- From an existing donation in your database.

		<field name="title">Reviewing Fundraising Materials - Individual Donors</field>
		<field name="content">Fiscally sponsored projects are required to submit their fundraising materials for review by Fractured Atlas staff before they get sent out to potential donors.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- individual appeal letters
- crowdfunding campaigns
- newsletters
- e-blasts
- web copy
- event programs

A good rule of thumb is that any document that mentions the name &quot;Fractured Atlas&quot; or offers tax-deductibility should be reviewed a member of the fiscal sponsorship team.

First, we will be looking to see that the standard text from pages 11-12 of the fiscal sponsorship program manual is included somewhere, even if it's just in fine print at the bottom of the document.

*[PROJECT NAME] is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of [PROJECT NAME] must be made payable to “Fractured Atlas” only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.*

Letters are frequently sent with the standard text edited by the project. We discourage projects from doing this as much as possible. There might be situations where it's appropriate for the first sentence and the second sentence of the standard text to be separated or for slight modifications to be accommodated, but the text needs to remain largely intact in order for staff to approve the document.

Fiscally sponsored projects, even those that include the standard text, often include statements that depict the fiscal sponsorship arrangement incorrectly. A common mistake is for projects to say that Fractured Atlas has granted them 501(c)(3) status. Please consult [this Internal Knowledge Base article](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/admin/Knowledgebase/view_article?id=673) for a list of no-no words to keep an eye out for.

We are also looking to see if the project is incentivizing donors with any rewards. This has the potential to make donations partially tax-deductible. If projects offer donors an incentive that qualifies as advertising, we will point out that this is a prohibited activity and will need to be revised. There is separate standard text for partially-deductible donations. 

*[PROJECT NAME] is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of [PROJECT NAME] must be made payable to “Fractured Atlas” only. The value of [GOODS OR SERVICES RECEIVED BY DONOR] is $[XX]. Any contribution above that amount is tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.*

There may be some situations where the partially-deductible text would be unwieldy, for example, if the project is offering multiple giving levels. In such case, we would have the project include the fully-deductible text and add a note next to each giving level stating &quot;(the amount over $XX),&quot; where $XX is the non-deductible value of the giving level. This is how partial-deductibility is expressed on Indiegogo and RocketHub campaigns.

Beyond that, the staff reviewer is looking to see if he or she can provide feedback to help maximize the effectiveness of the document. Some things to think about:
- Length: For an individual appeal letter, is it longer than 1-2 pages?
- Typos/Formatting: Are there suggestions you have for making it more aesthetically pleasing? If it's a letter, it should be a &quot;business-style letter&quot; with a date and an address for both the sender and recipient.
- Clarity: Does the project explicitly ask for a &quot;donation&quot; as opposed to &quot;support&quot; and do they make the ask early in the letter?
- Tone: Is the ask worded in a defeatist, subservient, or otherwise strange way? The material should be inviting and exciting!
- Donor-centric: Could the letter focus more on how the donor is involved and what impact they can make? The letter should use plenty of second person: how *you* can help, *your* donation, etc. The letter should also be as personalized as possible.
- Fundraising Goal/Specific Ask Amount: Could the project benefit from communicating their fundraising goal and making a specific ask amount that's tailored to each donor?
- Urgency: Does the project state a timeframe and make it clear that a donation is needed *now*?
- Instructions: Does the material provide clear next steps for donors to take in order to make a contribution?

		<field name="title">Fundraising Events</field>
		<field name="content">Fractured Atlas fiscally sponsored projects conduct fundraising events throughout their sponsorship with us. In anticipation of these events, we often encourage projects to reach out to us to go over their plans for the event, particularly with regard to selling tickets and/or receiving donations at the event itself. A few questions projects typically need to cover with us prior to the event:

#How should I sell tickets to my event?

There are a few options for fiscally sponsored projects to do this:
- If the project wants tickets to be tax-deductible or partially tax-deductible, they can set up giving levels via the Online Profile.
- If the project wants to sell fully non-deductible tickets, we typically encourage them to ticket through Arful.ly. This way, attendees can have the option to donate above the cost of admission.

#How can I receive donations at the event?

We encourage projects to set up a laptop at the event, so that donors can contribute by credit card then and there. We provide a special link for event tabling, that turns off fraud protection for their Online Profile. This allows many donations to come through one IP address in a short span of time, without flagging the computer as potentially fraudulent. The event tabling link can be found if the project logs in then goes to My Fiscal Sponsorship --&gt; Donations --&gt; Donation Link for Event Tables.

Projects can also receive donations by check at the event, then report them online and send them to us for processing. Cash donations cannot be considered tax-deductible.

Note: Projects should not collect credit card pledges from their donors at the event. It is prohibited for our projects to collect credit card information from their donors, as it creates a major liability for Fractured Atlas.

#How do I conduct an auction at my event?

Fractured Atlas projects frequently run silent auctions as part of their fundraising events. It's possible for silent auction bids to partially tax-deductible, if the winning bid is above the value of the item won by the donor. For example, if a donor bids $80 on an item valued at $50, $30 of that bid can be considered tax-deductible. We encourage projects to list the values of the items at the silent auction table, so donors are aware of the value when making bids. If the winning bid is greater than the value of the item, the donor can make payment by check, which can then be reported and sent to Fractured Atlas for processing. There's no simple way to conduct a silent auction by credit card, so we discourage our projects from trying to do so. If they like, they can receive payment directly by credit card for silent auction items, but it won't be considered tax-deductible.

#How do I receive noncash donations for my event?

Projects often solicit local businesses, particularly wineries, breweries, groceries, and venues, for donations of noncash goods/services for their events. Policies and procedures surrounding noncash donation processing hold true for this - in short, donations of goods can be considered tax-deductible while donations of services/space cannot. Projects can feel free to solicit businesses for donations of any kind, but it's important to point out to them what could be processed by Fractured Atlas vs. what cannot.

Most local businesses ask for 6-8 weeks to process requests of noncash donations, so it's important to encourage projects to factor that timeline into their event planning.

#Can I conduct a raffle at my event?

Raffles are governed and regulated by each State. Due to these regulations, Fractured Atlas is not able to accept money raised through a raffle or assist projects in conducting a raffle. Projects can conduct a raffle if they like, but funds should be received by them directly and would not be considered tax-deductible.

		<field name="content">### **Fiscal Sponsorship Program Fees**  


1. **Administrative Fee:** There is a base **7%** administrative fee on all donations, with no additional fees for processing credit cards. As a project raises more funds over the lifetime of your project, the fee is reduced. These lower fees apply to grants and donations by check, but not to donations by credit card:  
$0-$150K: **7%**  
$150K-$500K: **6%**  
$500K-$1M: **5%**  
$1M+: **4%**  

2. **Hourly Grant administration fee:** All fiscally sponsored projects are allotted 1 hour of grant administration per grant opportunity. After the first hour, projects will be charged a **$50/hr** fee for grant administration.

3. **Rush Fee for grant reviews:** We charge **$75** to rush review any grant application. Paying a rush fee ensures that a Fractured Atlas staff person will perform a preliminary review within 1 business day of receiving the completed grant application materials. Charging the fee is up to the discretion of the staff member reviewing the application.

4. **Fund Release Check Fee: $15**. All funds are released by EFT, but if there is an emergency and the project needs a check, we will charge a $15 processing fee to cut the check. 

5. **Stop-payment/Re-issue fee for fund release checks:** If a project opts to have a fund release check cut, there is a **$50** stop-payment and re-issue fee if the check is lost.

6. **Outgoing Wire Transfer Fee:** - We can initiate a fund release request by wire transfer for a **$25** fee. The transfer can take up to 5 business days to post to the recipient's account.

7. **EFT Reject Fees:** If an EFT attempt fails, we charge a **$10** fee unless the failure was due to staff error. 

8. **FedEx/USPS Express Fee:** If a project requires expedited shipping, we charge **$15** for staff time **plus the cost of the shipping**. </field>

		<field name="title">Fiscal Sponsorship No-No Words</field>
		<field name="content">This article is a running list of words/phrases mostly drawn from *Fiscal Sponsorship: 6 Ways to Do It Right* by Gregory L. Colvin and are red flags when reviewing fundraising material submitted by fiscally sponsored projects.

- Fiscal agency/fiscal agent (Sometimes grantmakers will use this phrase to refer to Fractured Atlas. Projects are not allowed to describe their relationship with us in this way.)
- Earmarked for the X project
- Acting as a conduit
- Pass-through
- Funnel
- Intermediary
- Partnership/joint venture
- Cooperative
- Shell
- Autonomous
- Laundering
- Go-between
- Parent company
- Curiously, Colvin believes that &quot;umbrella&quot; is an acceptable term, but we disagree and would not allow sponsored projects to describe the fiscal sponsorship arrangement in that way.</field>

		<field name="content">NYSCA

1. Send an email to all potential fiscally sponsored applicants to NYSCA a few months before the registration process begins. Send it to projects that have received funding the previous year or expressed interest. The email alerts them that they must wait to hear from FA before they can register and that FA must actually register each project. The email also provides them with a timeline of the registration process. And it prevents the projects from accidentally trying to create a profile on their own.

2. Once FA has updated our organizational information, another email is sent after the registration process opens. Once we have the word document registrations, save each one and enter it into the NYSCA website. Create an excel spreadsheet each year that documents each project's name, contact person, program applied to, deadline and the username and password.

4. Send each project copies of the final registration, application and final report (which you'll need to copy from the NYSCA website and paste into a word document.) Try to encourage projects to save all grant applications. Even if they don't save these copies, we have them on file for each year and can always re-send any copies they need.



CITY COUNCIL

The easiest agency to deal with as far as city council funding is the DCA. IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEMBER ITEMS AS PART OF THE FISCAL YEAR BUDGET ADOPTION PROCESS, GROUPS MUST SUBMIT A FISCAL YEAR DCA APPLICATION.

The City Council offers:

1) Capital Funding (for building costs/ bricks &amp; mortar)

2) Expense Funding (for project/ program costs)


Expense funding can come from one of three sources:

1) Discretionary member item (from individual Council Members - typically no more than $5k per group per year.)

2) Delegation Fund (from all the council members in a particular borough - projects must submit a form to the Manhattan Delegation, which used to require testimony from all applicants but starting in 2008 applicants will be selected to testify.)

3) Speaker's Fund (from the entire City Council as a whole - biggest pot of money.) As part of 2007's reforms, all the Speaker money allocated to cultural activities was handed over to the DCA to distribute through their competitive process.

The Manhattan Delegation funding must pass through a city agency (DCA, DYCD, DFTA).


Department of Youth and Community Development - DYCD

Fractured Atlas does not accept funding through the DYCD. The DYCD contracts are huge and not possible for Fractured Atlas to manage or handle in behalf of a project.


Department of Cultural Affairs - DCA

IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEMBER ITEMS AS PART OF THE FISCAL YEAR BUDGET ADOPTION PROCESS, GROUPS MUST SUBMIT A FISCAL YEAR DCA APPLICATION.

Eligibility:

- Projects must be incorporated in the state of NY in order to apply.

- The fundamental requirement for all proposals is that they represent a cultural activity of recognized quality accessible to the public.

- The services must occur with the City's Fiscal Year (July 1st - June 30th).

- Projects must have been in existence and have provided public services for no less than two years before applying for DCA funding.

- Projects must have either have filed a 990 with the IRS or an Audited Statement. If unavailable, the project must submit their balance sheet.


Deadlines and application procedures

- Seminars explaining the application process typically start in November.

- The application must be submitted by paper, although the DCA is hoping to have on-line application by 2010. The application is available to download at www.nyc.gov/culture.

- The application deadline is early February.

- The DCA will accept up to a maximum of five projects for support per applicant.

- $5k is the minimum award so the ask for each project needs to be at least that much. Each project needs to have a total budget of at least $10k. Organizations with project budgets less than $10K should be encouraged to apply directly to their local arts council re-grant program.

- The DCA will not fund more than 50% of a project budget and usually does not approach that level of support.

- Fractured Atlas sets an internal deadline for all applications to be at the Fractured Atlas office. Typically, this is three weeks before the official DCA deadline. This allows time for the review of the application, edits, and for FA to get the necessary paperwork together. Projects that applied the previous year should be sent an email reminder in December.


State Officials Discretionary Funding - (NY State Dept. for the Aging, Dept. of Parks and Rec, etc.)

There is no way for Fractured Atlas to accept discretionary awards from most state officials. In case anyone asks, you can tell them we did everything we could to try and work it out, but it is due to contractual restrictions within all of the state agencies and there is nothing the electeds can do to change it. Unless an organization is a fully vested exempt organization, there is not anyway around contract or agency based policy and procedures.


The Dept. for the Aging requires that we certify the project as an employee or independent contractor of Fractured Atlas, which is not possible given that it is an inaccurate and incorrect representation of the relationship we have with our fiscally sponsored projects.</field>

		<field name="content">#What is Rockethub?

RocketHub is a crowdfunding campaign that offers an innovative way to raise money (crowdfunding) and tangible opportunities to take creative products and endeavors to next level (LaunchPad Opportunities). RocketHub is a destination for emerging artists and entrepreneurs, and those who wish to discover and support innovative work.

#Step-by-step instructions for projects to set up a Rockethub campaign

1. Start at the My Fiscal Sponsorship page.  
2. Click the link to “Accessorize!” and “RocketHub”.  
3. Click on the link on the bottom of the webpage to connect your fiscally sponsored project to RocketHub.  
4. You will be brought to the RocketHub website where you can set up a RocketHub account and campaign.  
5. You must use the button from the Fractured Atlas website in order for it to be connected to Fractured Atlas.  
6. Remember, if you offer your donors a reward in exchange for their contribution, please make sure to list the partially deductible value when setting up the reward.  
7. After you launch the campaign, Fractured Atlas will review it and make it live on the RocketHub website.  

Timeline: Once you click LAUNCH, it can take up to five (5) business days for our staff to review and approve it. You will receive an email once it has been approved. Please plan accordingly.

#Credit Card Contributions

Donations to Rockethub campaigns can be made by credit or debit card. All funds raised for projects via Rockethub go directly to Fractured Atlas and are subject to the same 7% fee as all other credit card donations. Fractured Atlas cannot accept checks for Rockethub campaigns, and checks processed by Fractured Atlas cannot appear on the Rockethub campaign.

#How to review Rockethub campaigns

When projects create Rockethub campaigns, they can submit the campaign to us for approval. We then receive an automated e-mail from Rockethub, letting us know that the campaign is ready for review. When reviewing a Rockethub campaign, Fractured Atlas staff should look for the following:

- There is a leading video or image that is viewable to the public and properly functioning.
- The goods or services being offered in exchange for the donation are not prohibited by the terms of fiscal sponsorship.
- The &quot;Non Tax-Deductible Amount&quot; of any goods or services being offered in exchange for the donation is included in the correct place.
- The &quot;Non Tax-Deductible Amount&quot; of any goods or services being offered in exchange for the donation is less than the total amount of the donation.
- The campaign includes the standard text.

If the campaign is ready to go live, click &quot;Approve&quot; at the bottom of the campaign page.

Unlike Indiegogo, Fractured Atlas staff has no editing capabilities with individual Rockethub campaigns, and we have limited access to donor/campaign information via the Rockethub site. Rockethub's staff is quite responsive, though, and can be reached at support@rockethub.com.

		<field name="content">###What is Indiegogo? How do projects set it up?


Indiegogo is a collaborative way to fund ideas. Fiscally sponsored project can use Indiegogo's tools and process to enhance their fundraising and complement the tax-deductions made possible by Fractured Atlas. To connect their projects to Indiegogo, fiscally-sponsored projects should follow the below steps, which are detailed in [the Program Manual](/site/fiscal/Instructions.pdf):

1. Start at the My Fiscal Sponsorship page.  
2. Click the link to &quot;Accessorize!&quot; and &quot;Indiegogo&quot;.
3. Click on either of the options on the bottom of the webpage to connect the fiscally sponsored project to Indiegogo.
4. Check their inbox (this must be the email address they use for Fractured Atlas) for instructions from Indiegogo.
5. Follow the instructions in the email from Indiegogo to login to their website.
6. Once logged in using the Indiegogo emailed instructions, they can build their campaign on the Indiegogo website.
7. If they offer their donors a perk in exchange for their contribution, please make sure to list the partially deductible value when setting up the perk.
8. After the launch of the campaign, Fractured Atlas will review it and make it live on the Indiegogo website.

If a campaign is properly connected, an email notification will added to the helpdesk stating that &quot;New campaign connected to Fractured Atlas.&quot; You can then begin review at that point.

###Manually Connecting A Campaign

Sometimes, projects have begun campaigns before properly connecting to their fiscal sponsorship, so Fractured Atlas staff has to contact Indiegogo to get it manually connected. To do so, follow the below steps:

- Have the project email you their campaign's preview link. (Instructions for the project below.)

     1. Log in to your Indiegogo campaign dashboard.
     2. Go to option number 6 - &quot;Extras&quot;
     3. Select &quot;Generate Link&quot; under &quot;Share Your Draft Campaign.&quot;

- Once you receive the preview link, email the link to &quot;partnersupport@indiegogo.com.&quot;

- In the email, ask IGG to connect the campaign to the project's Fractured Atlas project ID.

- Inform the project that you've contacted IGG and remind them *not* to hit launch until the connect has been confirmed.

    *Live campaigns cannot be retroactively connected to fiscal sponsorship.*

- Once IGG let's you know that the campaign is connected, proceed with the normal review procedure.


###Reviewing a Campaign

Once a campaign is connected, a Fractured Atlas staff member receives the helpdesk notification and can begin the review. Staff should be looking for the following conditions:

- There is a leading video or image that is viewable to the public and properly functioning.
- The goods or services being offered in exchange for the donation are not prohibited by the terms of fiscal sponsorship.
- The &quot;Non Tax-Deductible Amount&quot; of any goods or services being offered in exchange for the donation is included in the correct place.
- The &quot;Non Tax-Deductible Amount&quot; of any goods or services being offered in exchange for the donation is less than the total amount of the donation.
- The campaign includes the standard text. 
- All perks require a shipping address.
- The campaign *has not* opted into InDemand.

If all of those conditions are met, the campaign can be approved. It is advisable to check with the project to confirm a launch date and time, if need be. If a project wishes to launch without perks, it is also advisable to let them know that they cannot add perks after the campaign is live - only Fractured Atlas staff can do so. This information needed to add a perk is below:

- Contribution Amount *(whole dollars only)*
- Perk Name *(limit 30 characters)*
- Nondeductible Amount *(whole dollars only)*
- Perk Description *(exactly as the project would like it to appear on the campaign. limit 500 characters.)*
- Number Available *(optional)*
- Estimated Delivery Date *(optional)*

If your space is ADA or AODA compliant, you can check the corresponding box. 
- For more information on the ADA, see [ADA.gov](http://www.ada.gov/ada_intro.htm)

- And for more information on the AODA, see [Ontario.ca's website on Accessibility laws](https://www.ontario.ca/page/accessibility-laws).

You can also indicate whether or not your space has an elevator, freight elevator, is accessible without stairs, and other search filters, but we've also added a few more unique options to make your space more visible. 

## Virtual Tours
If you have a virtual tour of the space, be  it a Youtube video, a Google 360 Degree virtual tour on Google StreetView, or something else entirely, you can add a link to this field. Listings that have a virtual tour will appear in search results when someone uses the &quot;virtual tour provided&quot; search filter, the tour will be linked on your listing. 

You can see some examples of spaces listings with virtual tours here:

- [The Fox Theatre](http://atlanta.spacefinder.org/spaces/12038?from_search=1)
- [The Abbey Pub](http://chicagospaces.fracturedatlas.org/spaces/11797)

- [Lucid Body House](http://nyc.spacefinder.org/spaces/8279?from_search=1)

This is a great way to help give all perspective renters a better idea of your space, and it gives disabled artists a lot of helpful information on whether or not your space will work for them.

## Accessibility Details Link

Some spaces have a page on their website dedicated to detailing their accessibility features. If you have such a page on your site you can add it here.

		<field name="content">*This feature is available with the Campaigns Kit, which is currently in Beta. If you are interested in turning this kit on for your organization, have your Organization Administrator contact us at support@artful.ly*

A **matching gift** is a charitable gift made to an organization by a matching organization (usually an employer) once an original donor has made a gift to that specific organization. For example, some employers have matching gift programs which state that they will match any donation made by their employees do charitable organizations. (Or, in this case, Fiscally Sponsored Projects or 501(c)(3) nonprofits.)

## To log a matching gift in Artful.ly:

1. Go to the **Fundraising** menu in the top navigation bar, and select **Log Donation/Pledge** from the drop down menu.
2. Enter the information about the donor and donation amount. 
3. On the right hand side of the page, select **Match Eligible.**
4. Enter the **Name** of an existing contact in your database. 
5. Enter a **Ratio**. (Most of the time, this is just 1 to 1.)
6. Enter an **Amount**.

 ![Add matching organization information](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=721 &quot;Add matching organization information&quot;)

Once you've saved the donation, this will be logged as a match eligible donation on the donors record, as well as on the matching organization's record.

##Track Outstanding Match Eligible Donations
1. Go to the **Fundraising** menu in the top navigation bar, and select **Outstanding Pledges**.
2. Here, you will see the list of any pledges or match eligible gifts that have not yet been received.
3. Click on the order for the matching organization's outstanding gift.
4. From the **Work with...** menu, select **Receive Pledge Payment** to confirm that your organization has the funds and log a donation on the organization's record.
5. From there, you can also schedule the payment for a future date.
6. This will mark the payment as **Paid in Full.**

It's a best practice to keep track of gifts that you've acknowledged and those that you have yet to acknowledge. That way, your staff can be up to date on who needs to be thanked for their generosity. It's possible to track acknowledgements for gifts in Artful.ly in a few different ways.

1. When adding a new donation, you can set a date that the acknowledgement was sent in the **Acknowledgement Date Sent** section, and add a **Method** for the acknowledgement.
2. For previously logged donations, find the order to **Edit** it. From there, you can set the date that the acknowledgement was sent, and add a method.

2. From here, you can specify a **Date** range, **Gift Type**, gifts from a certain **Campaign** or **Appeal**, or search for a specific person or company record.
3. Once you've found the gifts you're looking for, you can bulk add an acknowledged action from the **Work with...** menu, or export the list as a CSV.

 ![Unacknowledged gifts list](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=725 &quot;Unacknowledged gifts list&quot;)

**Big Picture **

The reason Fractured Atlas is making the transition to laptops is to give more flexibility in how and where we work. Want to collaborate with someone on the other side of the office? Just move on over to sit with them. Have a video conference meeting but it’s noisy by your desk? Now you can move somewhere quieter. The HVAC unit in part of the floor doesn’t work? Now you can move to somewhere cooler (although let’s cross our fingers that this will not be an issue).


**Security Checks**

Since it’s relatively easy for laptops to grow legs and walk away, we are instituting a few new security checks to insure that all of our machines are protected and can be remotely wiped in the unfortunate event of a theft. We will hold quarterly one-on-one security checks where each of us will demonstrate that all of the mandatory security precautions are installed and activated on our laptop. Don’t fret, these security checks aren’t opportunities for someone else to read our emails, look through our browser history, or sift through files. They’re merely a time for you to quickly show that the five or so items on our security list are in place—password, check; back-up turned on, check; etc. 


**Taking them on a field trip**

Like many of us, laptops love to travel. For now though, all laptops should stay in the Fractured Atlas office. After we get everyone up-and-running, we’ll move to evaluating what’s needed for laptops to leave the office.


**Can I use this laptop for personal things?**

These are work computers, so treat them as such. This shouldn’t change all that much from your current workflow.


**Oops!**

If your laptop is acting up or if it was dropped (or spilled on), contact itadmin@fracturedatlas.org so that a plan can be worked out to get any repairs done.


**Lost or Stolen?**

If you suspect your laptop is lost or has been stolen, email itadmin@fracturedatlas.org as soon as possible. This notifies Nicola and Shawn so they can start the process of tracking it down or remotely wiping the machine.


**Are you my laptop?**

We recognize that working in an office where everyone is using exactly the same laptop might lead to confusion about whose machine is whose. All the laptops will have a label with an ID number. If you can’t tell if a laptop is yours, either take a look at that number or open it up to see if the sign in is for your name. The mice and keyboards given to you will also have labels with this ID.


**But I want that case with the fun bedazzlement!**

We’ll be providing simple cases that do the job. If you want something extra you are totally free to buy something as long as it sufficiently protects the machine.

		<field name="title">Recipe for new SpaceFinder instance</field>
		<field name="content">This internal support article outlines the coordinated steps between the programs team and the development team to get a new regionally instance live on the SpaceFinder network.

SpaceFinder program team create/collect and provide:


1. Create header logo image (use Illustrator source file and customize region) for the new Instance and add this file to the pivotal story.  The logo should be in png format, transparent background, and at lease 200px in height.

2.  Create new reports in Restful Metircs, and provide keys for the following reports: “[InstanceName]_Accounts”, “[InstanceName]_DataCollection”, “[InstanceName]_SearchTrends”

3.  Create new property under Fractured Atlas Google Analytics account, and provide google analytics tracking code for:  “google_analytics”, “google_verification”

4. Determine primary domain and any vanity redirects (example: mass.spacefinder.org is primary, while SpaceFinderMass.com and SpaceFinderBoston.org redirect)

5. Research location customization and provide excel spreadsheet of zipcodes [example here](https://spacefinder.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200229429-Location-Search-by-Neighborhood)


Developer needs to:

In an image editing program (I use Sketch), you’ll need to create two images for the new instance (use the images for the existing instances in assets/images/themes/ as a guide.

 logo.png (transparent background, height: 98px, you will likely need to add additional transparent space around the logo to make it match the others)
email_header.gif (white background, dimensions: 550px by 91px, use other images as a guide for the amount of whitespace around the logo) 

These should go inside a folder named for the instance in ‘themes/‘

SpaceFinder Code Changes

- add new instance specifications to config.yml (you can use the standard domain structure for the ‘restful_metrics_domain’ unless the stakeholder specifies otherwise)
- the secure domain deviates from the pattern of most preferred domains.  It will likely be something like: 'spacefindernashville.fracturedatlas.org'.
- add new instance to copycoptor.yml
- create migration for new instance
- create migration for new domain
- create stylesheets/instances/application_[instance_name].sass

Checklist Canadian Instances:
- in config.yml, currency should be 'cad'
- look up the timezone and use the province abbreviation for the 'state' attribute
- set config.ml, metric_system should be true

White Label:  add '@import whitelabel_sso' to the stylesheet for the instance

Coming Soon:  If you set this to true, when the user selects the instance from the search dropdown, they will be re-directed to the home page (rather than a search of the spaces in the instance)

*To get it working locally and on staging, you’ll need to change the domain-related-attributes in the new domain and instance you created in the db to match what you’d expect in the environment.  You can also use tasks in instance.rake.

Analytics:
The metric_report credentials are provided by the stakeholder
Google Analytics:  
 - log into the google webmaster account for space finder (credentials in team password) and create a new domain.
 - log into google analytics and create the js for the google analytics report (you only need the tracking id for the config.yml file)  

CAS Code Changes
- add the logo file for the new instance (this appears when a new user signs up for an account from the instance)
- add the new instance to app/helpers/signups_helper.rb (there are several different possible places to add, depending on whether the instance is 'white label', canadian, custom domain, etc.)

SpaceFinder program team collect and provide before domain AFTER live/hosted:

1. Create and regionally customize the following spacefinder.org/admin/pages:
 - List Your Space [example here](http://chicago.spacefinder.org/pages/list-your-space) 
 - About [example here](http://mass.spacefinder.org/pages/about)
 - Community Partnerships [example here](http://mass.spacefinder.org/pages/community-partnerships)

 - Terms of Use [example here](http://mass.spacefinder.org/pages/terms-of-use)
 - Online Booking User Agreement [example here](http://chicago.spacefinder.org/pages/online-booking-user-agreement)
2. Add Footer links and logos [example here](http://chicago.spacefinder.org/admin/footer_links)

1. Create Restful Metrics reports
   - InstanceName_Accounts [example report here](http://www.restfulmetrics.com/reports/87?date_range_picker=2015%2F12%2F07+-+2015%2F12%2F14)

2. Create new property under Fractured Atlas Google Analytics [example here](https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?pli=1#management/Settings/a571893w44402964p44491885/)
3. Create new dashboard for Google Analytics metrics - use template from gallery [example here](https://www.google.com/analytics/web/?pli=1#dashboard/6lQvnz0OSqGdqJC69AjfRA/a571893w49242640p49733045/)</field>

		<field name="title">Processing donation and grant payments to the Fractured Atlas General Fund</field>
		<field name="content">The following instruction outline how to process various types of donations for the Fractured Atlas general fund. 

- **Check:**
Checks should be made payable to Fractured Atlas and mailed to our New York City office. Typically, they will come from institutional funders as well as individual donors. To process a check, head to the *Donors* tab and click *Record Donation*. Most likely, the donor will exist in the database, but can be added then, if necessary, using the processing form. Fill out all of the contact info (if it does not auto-populate) and donation details, and make sure that a project is NOT selected for the fiscal sponsorship field. If there is an associated grant in the tracker, make sure to select it, and add any necessary soft credits. Also, make sure you add information in the memo as to the reason for the gift (for example: &quot;stARTup Party 2015&quot; or &quot;2014 End of Year Appeal&quot;). You can leave *Send Receipt* checked, since that only sends a receipt to staff. Hit *Record Donation* when you're done.

- **ACH:**
Payments from governmental and institutional funders will often arrive via ACH (Automated Clearing House). Sometimes, they are referred to as electronic funds transfers or wire transfers. The finance team will alert development and fiscal sponsorship to the arrival of an ACH transfer, and ask that it be identified and processed. They will send the amount and name of the transferring entity, and it's up to fiscal sponsorship and development to determine who the funds are for (a project or the general fund) and which grant in the tracker should be associated with the funds. Once it is determined what the funds are, it should be processed in the same manner as a check, with the exception of a check number. After an ACH transfer is processed, the finance team needs to be altered with the donation ID so that they can manually deposit it into Quickbooks.

- **Stock:**
For a stock donation, the donor will need to get in touch directly with the development staff to request brokerage information.

		<field name="title">Donation Reports 2.0</field>
		<field name="content">This article covers how you retrieve donor information once it's in Artful.ly. For information on how your audience can make online donations, and how you can bring your donation history into Artful.ly check out these support articles: 

- [How can my fans make online donations?](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/how-can-my-fans-make-online-donations)
- [Donation Imports](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/importing-donations) (For 501(c)(3) organizations)
- [Converting a Ticket to a Donation](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/converting-a-ticket-order-into-a-donation) (For 501(c)(3) organizations)
- [Donations to Fiscally Sponsored Projects](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/donations-to-fiscally-sponsored-projects)

Once you have donations in your Artful.ly there are a number of ways you can find your donations, gain new insights about your donor base, and work with that information.

## Donation Alerts

There are a couple ways that you can ensure you and your colleagues are notified when your organization receives a donation via Artful.ly.

- [Daily Sales Reports](/site/knowledgebase/daily-sales-report) are sent to the Organization Administrator and whomever else is listed as a recipient. This is a summary of all orders and donations made to your organization for the day.
- Email alerts when a donation is made. From your **Account Administration** page under **Users**, the Organization Administrator can select who should receive an email notification when a patron donates to your organization. Read [Adding Users &amp; Managing User Permissions](/site/knowledgebase/adding-users-managing-user-permissions-) for more detailed instructions.

## Advanced Search
Searching for your donors through Advanced Search lets you looking for donors in combination with other useful information, like actions, ticket purchases, membership status, tags, and a whole lot more. Here's where you'll find out a lot more about your audience.

Advanced search is found in the people menu.

![A close up view of the people menu with an arrow pointing to Advanced Search](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=767 &quot;advanced search&quot;) 

From there you can build an advanced search for your desired donor search. 
![An example of an advanced search for donations between 26 and 78 dollars](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=765 &quot;Advanced Search for Donations&quot;)
For more information on building your advanced searches check out these articles: 

- [Advanced Search]()
- [Advanced Search glossary of terms]()

## Donation Reports
Donation reports can get you a list of anyone who has donated during a certain time period, along with their order numbers and links to their order details.

This is often more convenient than an advanced search for when you just need everyone who's donated you in a certain time period. For example, order reports are very useful when you want to pull all donations from the last month so you can send out acknowledgment letters and tax receipts.

Donation reports can be found in the orders menu at the top of Artful.ly. Date ranges can be specified, and by using the work with button, you can export your report as a CSV to work with in another application.

![The donation reports page with an arrow pointing to where to find donation reports in the Orders menu](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=764 &quot;donation reports&quot;)

## Exporting All Donations
Sometimes you just need everything all at once. That's what exporting your donation list is for. Exporting all donations gives you essentially the same information as a donations report, but instead of a specific time period, you get every donation logged in your Artful.ly account.

![Export all donations option](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=766 &quot;export donations&quot;)

Events are social experiences, and it's likely the majority of your tickets are purchased in at least sets of two. So, if a fan buys two passes, she can use both passes in the same order when buying tickets.

### Fractured Atlas staff are eligible for 11 paid company holidays each year in which the office is closed for business (all federal holidays plus the day after Thanksgiving).

If a company holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday will be observed as the holiday. If a company holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday will be observed as the holiday.

### The 11 holidays are as follows:

* New Year's Day (January 1)
* Martin Luther King, Jr's Birthday
* Presidents' Day
* Memorial Day
* Independence Day (July 4th)
* Labor Day
* Columbus Day
* Veterans Day
* Thanksgiving Day
* The day after Thanksgiving
* Christmas Day (December 25)

### The following days are 1/2 days:

* Thanksgiving Day Eve
* Christmas Eve
* New Year's Eve

In addition to these days, the office will close on **Federal Election Days** so you can take time to get to the voting polls.


## Company Holiday Tips

- Remember to [update your Help Desk status](/admin/Knowledgebase/view_article?id=537) as &quot;out of office/gone fishin&quot;
- Remember to update your voicemail with an away message
- Zimbra calendar does not include company holidays as default, add these dates to your calendar as 'out of office' as needed

		<field name="title">As a venue, should I be requiring liability insurance from my renters?</field>
		<field name="content">Renting out your venue space carries unique, associated risks and exposures. To limit these risks, you may consider requiring your renters to carry insurance:

**General liability insurance** covers damage to locations and injury to bystanders. This coverage is available on an annual and short-term basis, to fit your renters' needs.

**Why do certain venues require it from renters?**  

Venues will often require proof of insurance from renters to confirm that they have coverage in place. You may also consider asking to be listed as an Additional Insured entity for the risks and exposures related to a renter’s operations; this means that their insurance comes into play before any your venue carries.

**Why do some venues offer a master plan for their renters?**  

Venues can offer a TULIP (Tenant/Users Liability Insurance Protection) plan, which allows  all renters to be covered under the venue's insurance policy. This type of policy can keep renter claims separate from the venue's, while making sure that everyone can be covered. Venues can offer to include the renter as insured under a TULIP policy for an additional fee or include the cost in the rental charges.

**What exactly does a Certificate of Insurance (COI) from a renter cover?**  

A Certificate of Insurance is the document that provides proof of insurance, listing the venue as either Certificate Holder or Additional Insured (if this was requested).

**Additional insurance help:**  

[Fractured Atlas](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/about/): Fractured Atlas, the non-profit technology company that powers SpaceFinder, also helps the creative sector by offering affordable business insurance for the arts. In addition to being brokers for insurance, our friendly staff also come from artistic backgrounds, so they get both sides. Fractured Atlas has helped over 15,000 creative projects secure insurance. Depending on what else is involved in renting out your venue space, you may consider requiring other insurance types, which we can also help out with. For more info please visit our main [Insurance Program page](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/liability/).

**Note:**  

Fractured Atlas can only secure insurance for groups based in the US with US tax IDs.

**Canadian-based insurance help:**  

Many Canadian venues who require liability insurance work with their own preferred insurance providers, so start by asking a venue directly about options. Otherwise the Insurance Bureau of Canada is a general resource.</field>

		<field name="title">Processing Matching Gifts</field>
		<field name="content">### Processing Matching Gifts

Usually a matching gift requires the donor and Fractured Atlas staff to fill out the same form to process a gift but the procedure is always dictated by the corporation that operates the program. Employees always have to initiate the gift. FA must receive a donation from the donor prior to completing any matching gift forms. Once the donor has reported a donation to their company, a Fractured Atlas staff member will:  
1. Complete any paperwork required by the company to confirm the donation or confirm the donation online  
2. Set up a grant in the grant tracker  
3. Save Paperwork in the grant tracker   

**Entering the match into the grant tracker**  
1. Find the corporation providing the match in the admin panel. If one doesn't exist, create a New Prospect (under the &quot;Donors&quot; tab)  
2. Navigate to the corporation's &quot;Donations&quot; tab   
3. Click &quot;Log new grant application&quot;  
4. Title the grant application &quot;Match for [DONOR NAME], [DONATION DATE]
5. In the &quot;Fiscal Sponsee&quot; field, select the project that the original application was intended for 
6. Complete the rest of the form with relevant information 
7. The &quot;Ask Amount&quot; will be the donation amount confirmed (tax-deductible portion of any partially-deductible gifts)
8. Select &quot;Matched Original Confirmed&quot; from the Status dropdown menu  

**Processing the matching gift payment**  
When matching donation checks arrive at our office, they must be manually processed through the record donation page.  

To process the transaction:  
1. Find the grant application in the grant tracker that correlates with this matching gift and enter the amount of the donation in the &quot;Award Amount&quot; field  
2. Navigate to the Record Donations page under the &quot;Donors&quot; heading in the admin panel   
3. In the &quot;Existing Donor&quot; field, type the name of the company that is providing the match (i.e., Microsoft, Google, etc.), the company's contact information should auto-populate  
4. In the &quot;Optional Soft Credit&quot; field, select the donor who gave the original donation  
5. Enter the match amount
6. Enter the name of the fiscally sponsored project that received the original donation and is listed in the grant tracker
7. Make sure &quot;Check&quot; is selected as the type of donation
8. Enter the check number (if this is an ACH transfer, enter &quot;ACH transfer&quot; in the check number field)  
9. Select the grant application from the grant application dropdown menu  
10. Enter &quot;Matching gift from [DONOR NAME] on [DONATION DATE]&quot; in the memo field  
11. Unclick, &quot;Send Receipt?&quot; We do not issue receipts for matching gifts    
12. Click &quot;Record Donation&quot;  

**Now what? Send an email!**  
We'll need to notify the member about the donation. Send an email to the member alerting them to the gift: there is boilerplate email text for this connected to the F.S. Matching Gift tag. 

**There's more?**  
Sometimes a company will send multiple gift matches for multiple projects in one check. The processing procedure is the same, but run each contribution as a separate one for each match amount. Scan check and save to donor folder noting each project donated to. Put a note on the check with donation IDs for each match amount to alert whoever is doing a QB deposit that the check was run as multiple transactions.

		<field name="title">Donor-Advised Fund Procedure</field>
		<field name="content">### Donor-Advised Fund Procedure  

A donor advised fund gift is unique because we are legally barred from issuing a receipt for the gift - this is because donor-advised funds get one receipt for the total amount granted out each year by the organization that manages the fund. Donations of this kind are usually sent directly to FA with a letter designating the gift for a specific project. Therefore, the project does not need to report the donation before it arrives in our office. 

The project name on this letter must match the project name in our database. If the project name does not match, alert the project and ask them to contact the donor to request the donor advised fund send a corrected letter.   
 
**To process the transaction:**  
1. Navigate to the Record Donations page under the &quot;Donors&quot; heading in the admin panel  
2. In the &quot;Existing Donor&quot; field, type the name of the company that is providing the match (i.e., Fidelity, Schwab etc.), the company's contact information should auto-populate  
3. In the &quot;Optional Soft Credit&quot; field, enter the individual or fund that gave the original donation (if a donor record does not exist for this donor, create a New Prospect under &quot;Donors&quot; for the individual/fund giving the donation  
4. Enter the donation amount  
5. Enter the name of the fiscally sponsored project that is listed on the gift letter  
6. Make sure &quot;Check&quot; is selected as the type of donation  
7. Upload the gift letter send with the check as the &quot;Major Gift Letter&quot;  
8. Enter the check number (if this is an ACH transfer, enter &quot;ACH transfer&quot; in the check number field)  
9. Enter &quot;Donor-advised fund from [DONOR NAME]&quot; in the memo field  
10. Unclick, &quot;Send Receipt?&quot; We do not issue receipts for donor-advised funds  
11. Click &quot;Record Donation&quot;  

Email the member once the donation has been processed alerting them to the gift. There is boilerplate email text for this attached to the f.s. donor advised fund tag.

**What if the letter does not indicate a specific project?**  
It is possible that this donation is for Fractured Atlas, but also very likely that the donor did not list the intended project on the letter. In these cases, look in the admin panel to see if the donor exists and has given previously. If we have contact information for the donor, call them to determine if the donation was to be recommended for a specific project. If we do not have contact information for the donor, Google them to see if you can find a phone number for them. If we can find contact information doing a web search, call the donor. If you have searched and searched, but still cannot find contact information for the donor, give the check to the Development Associate. </field>

		<field name="title">Tips When Moving from Paper Calendar to Digital Calendar</field>
		<field name="content">Moving from paper calendar to a digital calendar is certainly a shift, yet one with many benefits. We recommend using [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar
) as it is free, and integrates with everything from smart phones to SpaceFinder! Some of the largest and most grand venues use Google calendar to manage rentals, so don't feel pressured to build a custom software solution for calendar.

## Here are a few things to keep in mind when preparing to make the switch:

### Start with an open discussion among your staff, ask yourselves:
 
- How often do we have to tell someone a space is not available?
- How much email goes back and forth over availability?
- How much of our space goes unrented?
- Do we have staff that need to collaborate on managing rentals?
- Do we have high turnover in the position that manages rentals?
- Do we have staff that feel confidant about working with a digital calendar?
- Do we often have double booking or confusion around rental times?
- What is our marketing budget to bring new renters in?
- How can being transparent about availability externally help us attract renters?
- How can being transparent about availability internally help us coordinate?

### Create Google Calendar account and keep in mind:

- Create a calendar for each unique space within your venue that you would like to rent
- Title each calendar clearly (no abbreviations, it will help you keep track)
- Consider how color coding of events on the calendar will be most useful to you
- Create test events on your calendar, play and learn BEFORE migrating all of your paper calendar bookings into Google.
- Consider who should have edit permissions to the calendar, and who should only be able to view, share accordingly


Some final words of encouragement...Youtube is filled with helpful tutorials on getting started with Google Calendar, so we won't repeat any of that here. Fractured Atlas's SpaceFinder program has worked with hundreds of venues on marketing their rentals. We've even helped church groups move from paper calendar to Google calendar, and it increased their bookings on SpaceFinder by 50%. We won't say it's easy, no change is completely friction free, but we can say it is a game-changer and we encourage you to take that step. Good luck!

		<field name="content">### Formating


**Header:**

SpaceFinder header logo is regionally branded, left aligned, and linked (but not campaign coded)

**Links:**

Use toronto.spacefinder.org as linking convention (rather than spacefindertoronto.org). This makes it easier to duplicate a message and customize for regional branding)

Always default to sending users to directory landing page, i.e. toronto.spacefinder.org/spaces rather than just toronto.spacefinder.org which is a welcome page


**Coded links:
**
Only campaign code 'calls to action' (usually created as buttons) to measure click thrus on messages.



**Campaign code convention:
**
Keep the source and medium consistent, and update the name as needed:

&amp;utm_source=Intercom&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=RenterEdu1

&amp;utm_source=Intercom&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=RenterEdu2

&amp;utm_source=Intercom&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=RenterEdu3

**Images:**

In general, do not link images that are not calls to action, instead use the button convention. Use fun images, make sure we have proper usage rights and credit the image.

**Signature:**

Do not sign intercom message as personal messages, i.e. &quot;Sincerely, SpaceFinder team&quot;

**Footer:
**
&quot;SpaceFinder is a program of Fractured Atlas&quot; (link to spacefinder.org and fracturedatlas.org/site/about)



**Regional Partner Credits (optional):
**
Option 1: &quot;SpaceFinder X is made possible by X, and X&quot; (link to individual websites)
Option 2: 1 image made from all partner logos (link to Community Partnerships page)


### Approval

Send a test email to someone other than yourself before setting live.

When working with regional partners, sending them a 'last looks' email is not required but is an appreciated courtesy (especially in Canada when there might be a better way to word something with such a different audience).

## To mark an individual as deceased:

1. View their record and select **Work with...**
2. Click on **Edit** to view their information and go to the **Attributes** section.
3. Check the box next to **Deceased**.

 ![Check deceased box to mark patron as deceased](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=811 &quot;Check deceased box to mark patron as deceased&quot;)

## When a patron is marked as deceased:
- The front page of her record will be prominently marked &quot;Deceased&quot;
- The Do Not Call and Do Not Email checkboxes will automatically be checked. (You can uncheck them if you wish.)
- If the individual was a member of a household, she will be marked as deceased in the household view too.
- When you export any list of people, her record will be marked in the deceased column. (You can also import records and mark individuals as deceased.)
- When you use Advanced Search, you can choose to include or exclude deceased patrons in your search. 

At this time, marking a patron deceased does NOT unsubscribe them from any MailChimp lists. You can do this manually for now and we'll work on including that automation in our next MailChimp upgrade.</field>

		<field name="content">Signing into Medium with an email requires a [two-step verification system](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213531928-Sign-in-by-email)—meaning that once you enter your email address, Medium sends a link to that address in order to sign-in. This should not be a problem for your individual @fracturedatlas.org accounts.

Here is how you can sign-in to the main Fractured Atlas Medium account:

- Enter this email address: **media@fracturedatlas.org**.
- This email address is a distribution list. Ask one of these staff members to forward you the verification link:   
  - Adam Huttler
  - Jason Tseng
  - Juliana Steele
- Do not log out unless you need to use your personal Medium account (which you would only use to write a Thought Piece, for instance). Medium will keep you logged in, so you will not have to use the two-step process every time you go onto the site.

		<field name="title">Sponsorship Confirmation Letters</field>
		<field name="content">The fiscal sponsorship team frequently receives requests to send letters of confirmation on behalf of fiscally sponsored project. These letters confirm that a project is fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas. Most often, these are requested by funders, or sometimes by vendors or service providers that seek to confirm that an organization is operating under a non-profit fiscal sponsor.

When the request is received, it's first important to confirm the following with the project (if they don't do so in their initial e-mail):

1. The name of the person or organization requesting the letter
2. Their mailing address
3. If it's a business, the contact person there (if there is one)
4. Any additional information the requester might need (Fractured Atlas's EIN, IRS Determination Letter, etc)
5. Why this information is being requested at this time

It's especially important to clarify this last point, so we can be sure to only issue letters like this in instances where it's appropriate to do so, and so we can tailor any language to the needs of the request.

Once the above is confirmed, you can put together a letter using the template in the Shared Drive (Fiscal Sponsorship &gt; Sponsorship Letters). Complete the letter and PDF it, and then you can send it to the project to pass along to the person or business requesting the information.</field>

Fractured Atlas issues tax receipt for all donations processed for the purposes of our fiscally sponsored projects, unless they are [donor-advised](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/admin/Knowledgebase/view_article?id=695) or [matching gifts](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/admin/Knowledgebase/view_article?id=694). 

**Check or Wire Donations**
1. We will email a receipt to the project for which the gift was recommended. 
2. If the check is $1,000 or more, we will mail a paper copy. Development takes care of mailing these receipts along with a thank you note. 
3. If the check is $250 or more, the Membership Associate will mail a paper copy. We do not share this information with our projects. 
4. If the check is $75 or more and is partially tax-deductible, the Membership Associate will mail a paper receipt. We do not share this information with our projects. 

**Online Donations**
1. We will email a receipt to every donor who contributes online. They will be required to provide their email addresses at the time the donation is made. 
2. We will email a receipt to every project when they receive online donations.
3. Development will mail a paper receipt for all online contributions of $1,000 or more. 

All donation receipts can be downloaded from a project's Donation History on their My Fiscal Sponsorship page.

		<field name="title">Staff Donation Allowance</field>
		<field name="content">At the start of each fiscal year, Fractured Atlas staff members are allocated an allowance to donate to fiscally sponsored projects. The amount may vary from year to year and will be announced at the beginning of each fiscal year. If you do not use the allowance by the end of the fiscal year, you lose it.

**Instructions on making a donation to a project**

1. Search for the project you would like to give to in the Fractured Atlas database. You can use this [link](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/admin/Fiscal/project_tracker?prompt=id-autocomplete).
2. On the fiscal sponsorship tab of the project you would like to give to, click on the yellow star icon next to the project name at the top of the page.
3. Enter in the amount of the donation you would like to make and click donate. (This will both trigger an email notification to the project and add your name to their Supporters list on their fiscal sponsorship page  - see examples below)
4. Email the project and let them know you made a donation.
5. Share your donation on social media and tag the project or member.

**Guidelines for making donations**

- Fractured Atlas requests you do not publicly share that these are funds from Fractured Atlas, but rather from you.
- Each donation will be made under your name and Fractured Atlas may promote your donations. 
- Please do not donate to a project that you lead.
- Please give at least $5 each time you give.
- You can also choose to give your entire allowance to one project.
- Your &quot;donations&quot; tab on your staff member record in the Fractured Atlas database should be marked as &quot;no&quot; next to the question &quot;Anonymous&quot;.

**Tips for finding projects to donate to**

- Read the project of the month blog on Fractured Atlas's website.
- Search for projects in your geographic area. You can search on our website by state and discipline [here](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/browse_projects). Or you can search in our database [here](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/admin/Fiscal/project_tracker?prompt=id-autocomplete) by metro area, discipline and a number of other filters. 
- Make notes at the staff meetings about projects that are shared each month.
- Ask fiscal sponsorship staff members if they know of any projects that are doing something really interesting, have an active crowdfunding campaign, or the members are people that are really nice to work with.
- Look at who other staff members are giving to.
- Look at the &quot;[Meet our Sponsored Projects](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/meet_projects)&quot; page - it changes everyday.

		<field name="title">Fractured Atlas 401K Plan</field>
		<field name="content">###  401(k) Retirement Plan

**Welcome to the wonderful world of long-term financial planning!** 

Fractured Atlas employees are eligible to participate in the company's 401(k) plan upon hire.  The 401(k) plan is administered by BPAS in partnership with Ritholtz Financial Management.  The plan is fully vested immediately - there is no waiting period.  

### Traditional vs. Roth
 
You may contribute to either a Traditional 401(k) (pre-tax, but taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth 401(k) (post-tax, but tax-free upon withdrawal) or both.  Fractured Atlas sets no limits on the amount you may contribute, but the IRS does set a maximum annual amount.  

### Matching 

Fractured Atlas provides limited matching for your contribution.  **The first 4% that you contribute each pay period is matched 1:1.**  To receive the maximum matching contribution you must contribute at least 4%.  Note that the employee match will always go into the traditional 401(k); contributions to the Roth 401(k) must come from the employee.  

### Getting Started and Making Changes 

**Enrollment happens online.**  After you're first payroll is processed (the 15th or last day of the month) you will receive a letter in the mail from BPAS, our Plan Administrators.  Use the credentials you receive in this letter to log in to your &quot;Participant Account&quot; at **[bpas.com](http://www.bpas.com)** and fill out the online enrollment form.  BPAS says it should take about 10 minutes to sign up (it's helpful if you know the details of the person you'd like to be your beneficiary, but not mandatory). Once you submit your form, your contribution and employer match will be applied to the next payroll we process.  

Upon Request, the People team can mail you a Ritholtz/BPAS 401K informational package.  This will have the details of our plan, all the funds/portfolios available and has some tools and templates to help with determining how much to contribute and target fund totals for people who are new to the 401K game.

There will be an annual overview presentation for staff at the beginning of each fiscal year to answer general questions and give updates on the plan. 

1 to 1 meetings with our Ritholtz Financial Advisor will occur annually following the overview presentation.      </field>

		<field name="content">Ideally, when a stakeholder writes a story in Tracker, it should follow this anatomy:

### Title

One sentence that describing the story. 
&gt; As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit].

### Description

Give a little more context and definite the Acceptance Criteria.

### Acceptance Criteria

This defines exactly what should happen. Use this format:
&gt; Scenario 1: Title 

&gt; Given [context] 

&gt; And [more context] 

&gt; When [event] 

&gt; Then [outcome] 

&gt; And [another outcome] 

A helpful way to think about this is 

&gt; CONTEXT + ACTION + OUTCOME = GIVEN + WHEN + THEN.

Staff members should answer as many questions as they can and then find the appropriate person to transfer the member to if it is beyond the scope of your specific expertise. You should check with the appropriate staff member before completing the transfer. If they don't answer or are unavailable, you can let the member know you are transferring them to voicemail or, if urgent, try to get another staffer to help.  

Here is a general breakdown of different tasks across programs as of Feb. 2016:

**Artful.ly:**
  
•	General Demo &amp; Questions - Marcus &amp; Alessandra  
•	Selling Memberships &amp; Passes - Marcus

		<field name="title">Kits</field>
		<field name="content">Have you ever felt overwhelmed by a pice of software that was full of features you never use? We feel you. That's why Artful.ly is built to be modular, so outside of the basic CRM and Free ticketing features, you choose which features to add. We call those sets of features *kits*, and they're activated from the Account Administration page.

![A view of all of the available kits](/site/Knowledgebase/view_image?id=848 &quot;all available kits&quot;)

## What kits are available?
- **Paid Event Ticketing** Want to add prices to your tickets? Start here. To activate the kit we need a completed [EFT form and a copy of a voided check](https://www.artful.ly/forms/artfully_etf_sign_up.pdf).
- **Fiscally Sponsored Donations** Fiscally sponsored projects can link their Artful.ly account with their fiscal sponsorship, which synchronizes donor contact information and donation records into the Artful.ly CRM. Once the accounts are linked, ticket buyers also have the opportunity to add a donation at checkout. Steps to link the two accounts are in this support article: [Connect Your Sponsored Project &amp; Artful.ly Account](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/connect-your-sponsored-project-artful-ly-account)
- **501(c)(3) Donations** Organizations with their own 501(c)(3) may activate a donations kit that allows ticket buyers to add a donation at checkout, as well as set up a storefront specifically for accepting donations. This kit requires the EFT form and a copy of your IRS Determination letter. Detailed instructions are here: [Enabling Donations for 501(c)(3) Nonprofits](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/enabling-donations-for-501-c-3-nonprofits)
- **MailChimp** We have an integration with MailChimp that will sync your MailChimp lists with Artful.ly and record when you send email marketing campaigns to your supporters. Plus on the MailChimp side you get access to their excellent email analytics tools. More information on MailChimp can be found in [What is MailChimp and why should I use it?](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/what-is-mailchimp-and-why-should-i-use-it) Already have a MailChimp account? Instructions to connect it to Artful.ly are here: [Connecting Your Artful.ly &amp; MailChimp Accounts](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/connecting-your-artful-ly-mailchimp-accounts).
- **Print at Home Scannable Tickets** With this kit, your ticket buyers receive a PDF with QR coded tickets whenever they make a purchase. You can scan those tickets, either printed or on customer phones using the Artful.ly check in app for iPhones and iPod touches. The app also doubles as a mobile door list. More on the kit here: [Print at Home Scannable Tickets Kit](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/print-at-home-scannable-tickets-kit)
- **Passes** (in beta testing) This kit allows organizations to set up flex and season passes. Details are in the [Passes Overview](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/beta-passes-overview-activation-)
- **Memberships** (in beta testing)Organizations with the Memberships kit can set up member only ticket prices and create events exclusive to members. Read more here: [Memberships Overview](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/beta-memberships-overview)
- **Relationships &amp; Households** (in beta testing) Knowing who knows who within your network is a powerful way to understand the connections between your supporters. That's where the Relationships and Households kit comes in. Learn more in: [Tracking Relationships Between Patrons](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/beta-tracking-relationships-between-patrons).
- **Campaigns** (Coming Soon) When it releases, the Campaigns Kit will help with running fundraising campaigns and tracking appeals. If you're interested in beta testing the kit, add a vote to the [Campaigns Feature Request](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/feature_request_view?id=190).
- **Assigned Seating** (Coming Soon) Features to sell assigned seats and hold seats. Interested in being a beta tester? Add a vote to the [Assigned Seating Feature Request](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/feature_request_view?id=311)

## What do you mean by beta?
Artful.ly is in a constant state of development, and producer feedback is one of the biggest influences on how new features get made. A big part of that is our [Feature Request Forum](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/knowledgebase/feature_request_list?topic=Artful.ly), where producers can vote on requests and suggest new ones. We do our best to take producer voters into account as much as possible when developing new features. 

Before a new kit gets turned loose so anyone can turn it on, we put features through a closed beta period. Interested organizations can chat with us about whether or not the kit will meet their needs, sometimes we'll train them on how to use the features, and if it's a good fit we'll turn the kit on for them. 

When a kit is in beta we consider it to be in a state where an organization can use it in their day to day, but there's the possibility that small issues can come up. When that happens, we ask beta testing organizations to reach out to us so we can confirm, and then if it's an issue, get it fixed. 

Organizations that beta test help shape how kits get refined. We ask for feedback on the kits, and use it to further iterate on the new features.  If you're interested in beta testing any of our kits currently in beta, let us know. We're happy to talk with you about it.
